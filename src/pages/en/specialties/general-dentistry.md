  body: "<p><strong>The General Dentist is trained to prevent, diagnose and treat
    common problems of the general public</strong>. If you require a ROUTINE CHECK
    or Basic Dentistry such as caries removal, cleaning, prophylaxis or oral prosthesis
    without aesthetic, functional or periodontal compromise; a general practice professional
    can provide you an excellent service. However, because the different areas of
    Dentistry have become increasingly complex and highly technified, <strong>there
    are numerous cases that require the intervention of professionals with long and
    intensive training called Specialists</strong>. These individuals are particularly
    trained to execute techniques and advanced procedures providing highly predictable
    and often surprising results for patients.</p><p><strong>A good General Dentist
    is responsible for performing the triage and primary diagnosis of the patient</strong>,
    solving hygiene problems and CARIES RESTORATION that may be presented and refer
    him; if necessary, to the most indicated Specialist. It is important to clarify
    that <strong>a true Specialist must have completed fourth level or Postgraduate
    studies</strong> at a recognized national or foreign University, with an academic
    curriculum that covers the teaching hours required by the different Scientific
    Societies of the country.</p><p><strong>The Generalist must have solid knowledge
    of oral pathology, radiology, periodontics and gnatology</strong> to be able to
    detect the presence of lesions or diseases in the tongue, gums, soft tissues and
    temporomandibular joints. He must also be an expert in OPERATIVE DENTISTRY, since
    <strong>he is usually the one who does the cavitary preparations necessary for
    the treatment of Dental Caries</strong>, applying conservative designs and trying
    to preserve pulp vitality at all times, to finally; return to the organ its usual
    anatomy and functionality through the dental restoration process. He must therefore
    know and properly manage the different adhesive systems based on the acid etching
    technique, the multiple restorative materials based on dental composites and the
    most basic and universal principles of occlusion and masticatory function.</p>

  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  blocks:
  - questions:
    - question: What are the most common diseases that affect teeth and gums?
      answer: "<p>The most frequent oral pathologies are caries and periodontal conditions
        <em>(gingivitis and periodontitis)</em>. Then, to a lesser extent; infectious
        diseases of bacterial origin, physical trauma, congenital lesions and mouth
        cancer. According to the World Health Organization between 60% to 90% of school-age
        children and about 99% of adults suffer from tooth decay, often accompanied
        by pain or feeling of discomfort.</p>\n"
    - question: Is it possible to avoid them?
      answer: "<p>Although the genetic component is decisive, the incidence of oral
        diseases can be significantly reduced by controlling the known risk factors.
        The control of dental plaque through the constant practice of a correct oral
        hygiene technique, the reduction of sugar intake, the well-balanced diet rich
        in fruits, vegetables and fiber; the reduction of alcohol consumption, the
        cessation of smoking habit, the periodic professional controls and the topical
        applications of fluoride; will have a favorable impact on the appearance and
        prevalence of caries, periodontal diseases and oral neoplasms.</p>\n"
    - question: What is bacterial plaque?
      answer: "<p>Dental or bacterial plaque is a white-yellowish sticky substance
        that easily adheres to teeth and accumulates many species of microbes <em>(aerobic
        and anaerobic)</em> within an intercellular matrix of organic origin. The
        plaque is formed from food debris that has not been removed and that serve
        as a perfect substrate for colonization and multiplication of bacteria. The
        importance of its control lies in the fact that it is the main cause of the
        two most common infections of the oral cavity: Dental Caries and Periodontal
        Disease.</p>\n"
    - question: How is it different from calculus or dental tartar?
      answer: "<p>Dental calculus, also known as dental stone or dental tartar, is
        the result of solidification of the bacterial plaque by the precipitation
        and progressive accumulation of mineral salts; calcium and phosphorus mainly.
        Because it is a mineralized, rough and firmly adhered to the teeth material,
        it houses and retains enormous amounts of bacterial plaque on its surface,
        and unlike it; it cannot be removed by the toothbrush. Only a professional
        cleaning can eliminate it.</p>\n"
    - question: Is it normal for the gums to bleed when I brushing my teeth?
      answer: "<p>At all! Although such a phenomenon could be due to a systemic condition,
        the usual cause is due to the chronic accumulation of dental plaque that generates
        a reversible inflammatory pathological entity known as Gingivitis, but that
        aggravated; leads to the formation of tartar, pathological sacs, resorption
        of the alveolar bone and teeth fall <em>(Periodontitis)</em>. Hemorrhage of
        gingival origin is the most obvious sign of the so-called Periodontal Disease.</p>\n"
    - question: Why does bad breath occur?
      answer: "<p>Halitosis, also known as bad breath, is defined as the set of unpleasant
        odors that are emitted through the mouth. It is a problem that affects one
        in three people and is associated with poor oral hygiene or diseases of the
        oral cavity; although sometimes, it can be a clinical manifestation of some
        other systemic or gastrointestinal disease.</p>\n"
    - question: Which is the best oral hygiene technique?
      answer: "<p>That which is practiced religiously after each meal and that contemplates
        the use of the conventional brush, interproximal brush, dental floss and mouthwash.
        Optimal brushing takes at least three minutes of time and to perform it properly
        we must place the bristles on the dental surface and its adjacent gum with
        an angle of 45 degrees, to then; apply short and smooth horizontal movements
        paying special attention to the tooth-gum interface, hard to reach back teeth
        and areas where there are fillings, crowns, orthodontic appliances or dental
        implants. Never forget to brush your tongue.</p>\n"
    - question: Are electric brushes better than manual ones?
      answer: "<p>Both are definitely effective, with both types you can achieve optimal
        and adequate tooth brushing. You can use the one that suits you, as long as
        the technique is appropriate. Electric brushes may work better than manual
        ones in people with limited dexterity, arthritis, degenerative or mental diseases
        that compromising motor skills.</p>\n"
    - question: How often should I visit the Dentist?
      answer: "<p>Normally recommended once a year. Fortunately, the process of caries
        and tartar development is relatively slow if reasonable oral hygiene is practiced;
        so a check every 12 months will be adequate to prevent diseases, detect and
        treat incipient lesions and maintain healthy mouth, teeth and gums. However,
        for some people with pre-existing pathologies, extensive oral rehabilitations,
        dental implants, orthodontic treatments or bad habits; a higher frequency
        may be necessary, which can range between 2 and 4 times a year. A typical
        case is that of those patients who suffer from gingivitis or chronic periodontitis,
        and who usually require permanent periodontal support therapy.</p>\n"
    - question: Why are several X-rays necessary to make a good Oral Diagnosis?
      answer: "<p>Because they expose details that are not accessible to the human
        eye. Only through radiological images we will can detect the very frequent
        proximal caries <em>(those that form on the contact surfaces of the teeth)</em>,
        alveolar and interproximal bone alterations and resorptions, periodontal diseases,
        pulp and periapical conditions, root resorptions, impacted teeth, odontogenic
        tumors and cysts and defective or permeable restorations; among other anomalies.
        A Diagnosis without the support of radiographic evidence will always leave
        much to be desired.</p>\n"
  - questions:
    - question: What is a tartrectomy or prophylaxis?
      answer: '<p>It is what is popularly known as "dental cleaning". Tartrectomy
        is a clinical procedure that consists of the mechanical removal of all calculus
        and dental plaque accumulated in the teeth, gingival margin and interdental
        spaces; through the use of ultrasonic devices and special dental instruments.
        It should be practiced periodically, every 6 or 12 months, since there are
        areas in the mouth that even a correct brushing cannot reach.</p>

'
    - question: What is a tooth polishing?
      answer: "<p>Both natural and artificial teeth suffer wear, and over time, they
        acquire certain roughness on their outer layers that it is advisable to remove.
        There are several techniques for this that provide not only an aesthetic benefit,
        but also a hygienic and functional ones; since a smooth and polished surface
        retains a smaller amount of dental plaque and is then easier to address and
        clean.</p>\n"
    - question: What are the benefits of a topical fluoride application?
      answer: "<p>This chemical element gives three main benefits: it increases the
        resistance of the enamel, is antibacterial and promotes remineralization.
        Fluorides directly inhibit the formation of bacterial acids and contribute
        to the incorporation of calcium and phosphate ions in the enamel, decreasing
        its susceptibility to tooth decay. Normally they are applied in gel form with
        the use of special trays and directly on the dental surface.</p>\n"
    - question: How are cavities formed?
      answer: "<p>If they are not removed periodically, the bacteria contained in
        the dental plaque generate powerful organic acids that attack and demineralize
        the hard or inorganic tissues of susceptible teeth. Thus, on the surface of
        the enamel, grooves and cracks may be formed that will cause the entry of
        new bacteria and the proliferation of a greater amount of dental plaque. This
        demineralization process can be reversible in the early stages; however, the
        continued attack of the acids will lead to further destruction of the tooth
        enamel and the creation of holes on the tooth surfaces that could reach the
        dentin, and even; to the dental pulp, compromising then its vitality.</p>\n"
    - question: How are they cured or eliminated?
      answer: "<p>It depends on the development, extension and depth of them. If it
        is incipient or moderate all infected tissue is removed and the cavity is
        sealed with a special material, usually based on Dental Composite¬†Resins.
        In more advanced states caries usually affects the dental pulp or nerve of
        the tooth, and it is then necessary to perform a Root Canal Treatment. In
        addition, after Endodontics; a Ceramic Inlay, Onlay or Crown is usually indicated
        to protect the weakened remaining dental structure and prevent its fracture.</p>\n"
    - question: Is dental amalgam still used?
      answer: "<p>Although the appearance of new adhesive materials for direct filling
        has been very beneficial from the aesthetic point of view, they do not in
        any way affect the relevance and indication of other traditional materials
        that are even yet more resistant, more durable and more economical. This is
        the case of silver amalgam, which undoubtedly remains like the best option
        in situations where restored teeth, by the type of occlusion or bite; are
        exposed to considerable forces or overloads, as in many posterior teeth, at
        the level of molars.</p>\n"
    - question: What are and how are Dental Composites placed?
      answer: "<p>They are synthetic materials mixed heterogeneously to form a single
        compound of varied elements. They are used in Dentistry to fill teeth because
        they are very aesthetic, and in addition; because they adhere micromechanically
        to their surface using the acid etching technique. Composite Resins consist
        of a polymeric organic component called matrix and an inorganic component
        that acts as a filler mineral. They are generally photosensitive and halogen
        light is used for their placement.</p>\n"
    - question: When is it necessary to replace an old filling?
      answer: "<p>The answer is very simple: when there is dental sensitivity, when
        the material is damaged, broken or fractured, when marginal filtration and/or
        recurrence caries is observed or when a radiographic study shows a coronal
        radiolucent area that suggests a failure of cohesive type.</p>\n"
    - question: What is Bruxism?
      answer: "<p>Bruxism is the involuntary habit of clenching or grinding the teeth
        without functional purposes. It affects between 10% and 20% of the population;
        being able to generate headache, pain of the masticatory muscles, neck and
        ears. Grinding habit, if not treated on time, can lead to wear or fracture
        of the teeth completely; compromising the aesthetics and occlusal function
        of the person.</p>\n"
    - question: " When is a night splint indicated?"
      answer: "<p>The occlusal, discharge, stabilization or deprogramming splint;
        is a transparent, hard and custom-made acrylic resin device that is placed
        on the upper or lower arch <em>(depending on the characteristics of the case)</em>
        of the patient, and which is used for palliative treatment of Bruxism and
        to reduce muscle hyperactivity associated with occlusal, functional and inflammatory
        disorders of the temporomandibular joint <em>(TMJ)</em>. Also, we indicate
        it routinely as a protective device in patients with extensive fixed or implant-assisted
        rehabilitations.</p>\n"
