  body: "<p>The smile is the light of our face, allows us to interact better with
    people, cause a good impression and makes persons show more empathy when it comes
    to interacting with us. <strong>Smiling often will change your life, improve your
    mood, your charisma and your self-esteem.</strong></span></p> <p>Considering the
    beauty of the smile as the great north and supreme objective of Orthodontics,
    in DENTAL VIP we use with great success the STRAIGHT WIRE TECHNIQUE with preadjusted
    devices according to the philosophy and prescription of Dr. Ronald Roth for the
    treatment of malocclusions and dental malpositions. <strong>This technique </strong></span><em><strong>(Straight
    Wire System)</strong></em></span><strong> uses very light forces that allow us
    to move the teeth with total accuracy in the 3 planes of the space</strong></span>,
    achieving ideal positions perfectly compatible with the most demanding standards
    of contemporary dental aesthetics. In that sense, we can use conventional or <strong>aesthetic
    brackets</strong></span>; it all depends on your preference.</span></p> <p>In
    the initial phase of DIAGNOSIS we use <strong>digital photographs, panoramic radiographs
    and computerized cephalometries</strong></span> <em>(Ricketts, Jarabak, Downs
    and Steiner)</em> to plan all orthodontic mechanotherapy and achieve highly predictable,
    aesthetic and functional results.</p> <p>Additionally, we routinely handle <strong>craniofacial
    growth modification techniques</strong> for the treatment of skeletal malocclusions
    in children and adolescents, through the use of DENTOFACIAL ORTHOPEDICS and functional
    jaw orthopedics devices <em>(removable appliances)</em> that allow us to recover
    the facial and biological balance lost by developmental disorders.<strong> In
    the extreme cases of severe dentofacial deformities, a combined Orthodontic-Surgical
    approach is already necessary</strong>, so that the execution of the treatment
    implies the joint and coordinated participation with the Maxillofacial Surgeon,
    who will be responsible for repositioning the affected maxillary structures through
    the various procedures of ORTHOGNATHIC SURGERY.</p>\n"

    and small details that can be achieved in the finishing phase will define the
    excellence of the result. That is why in some people the teeth will look really
    beautiful, and in others, just straight.

  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  blocks:
  - questions:
    - question: What is Orthodontics?
      answer: "<p>It is the Specialty of Dentistry responsible for the prevention,
        diagnosis and treatment of malocclusions and dentofacial deformities. It is
        based on the knowledge of the craniofacial growth, development process and
        the domain of biomechanics, a science that deals with studying and controlling
        the vectors, intensities, senses and physical effects of the forces that need
        to be applied on the teeth to move them and correct your position.</span></p>\n"
    - question: What is a malocclusion?
      answer: "<p>It is any irregular arrangement of the teeth and jaws that affect
        the aesthetic and masticatory function of the person. There are dental malocclusions
        and skeletal malocclusions, that is why is so important the DIAGNOSIS in Orthodontics.
        The most common dental malocclusion is the crowding and is due to a discrepancy
        between the size of the teeth and the size of the jaws. Skeletal ones derived
        from alterations of facial growth and development, and are characterized by
        abnormalities of shape, size and position of the maxillary bones.</span></p>\n"
    - question: What is a dentofacial deformity?
      answer: "<p>It is a skeletal and dental malocclusion of such magnitude that
        it also compromises the facial aesthetics of the person. In these cases, orthodontic
        treatment alone is not enough and must be combined with Orthognathic Surgery
        procedures so that the Maxillofacial Surgeon can reposition the dysplastic
        maxillary structures.</span></p>\n"
    - question: Why is it important to correct malocclusions and align teeth?
      answer: "<p>Because socially it is very favorable to have a good appearance,
        and also, in large part; because oral health depends on a correct occlusion
        or bite. Straight and aligned teeth are easier to clean and less susceptible
        to cavities and periodontal diseases.</span></p>\n"
    - question: Do I need a Dentist or an Orthodontist?
      answer: "<p>During the Dentistry degree, barely some basic concepts about Orthodontics
        are taught, therefore additional specialization studies </span><em>(</em></span><em>University
        Postgraduate degree of 2 or 3 years duration</em><em>) </em></span>are required
        to be truly trained in the area. Keep this always in mind, avoid failures
        and bad experiences that are unfortunately very common. Short courses and
        Orthodontic fellowships are excellent for the General Dentist to learn to
        detect and intercept some malocclusions, but in no way quialify him to carry
        out corrective Orthodontic treatments.</span></p>\n"
    - question: What is the best age to start an Orthodontic treatment?
      answer: "<p>There is no specific age, it all depends on the type and severity
        of the problem. </span>It is ideal to attend to consultation during the mixed
        dentition period </span><em>(between 7 and 9 years old)</em></span> to rule
        out any dental and especially skeletal alterations, since growth modification
        </span><em>(Orthopedics)</em></span> is only possible before maturity or sexual
        development. Purely dental malocclusions can be treated at any stage of life.</span></p>\n"
    - question: How long does a treatment of this type last?
      answer: "<p>It also depends on the case, but as a general rule the time varies
        between 18 and 24 months. In those patients with severe abnormalities, the
        duration may be longer by virtue of the degree of skeletal and dental involvement.</span></p>\n"
    - question: Is it always necessary to extract permanent teeth?
      answer: "<p>Of course not! This is determined based on the dento-maxillary discrepancy
        or degree of dental crowding. Extractions are indicated in approximately 30%
        of cases.</span></p>\n"
    - question: Which are better, fixed or removable appliances?
      answer: '<p>Fixed appliances or brackets are the only dispositives capable of
        accurately moving teeth in the 3 planes of space. Removable appliances are
        used to modify growth, to "move" bones and achieve orthopedic changes, but
        they are very bad for aligning teeth. Each type has its indications and specific
        uses.</span></p>

'
    - question: What are the differences between metal brackets and aesthetic brackets?
      answer: "<p>Mainly the color and the material. The aesthetic brackets are made
        of plastic, porcelain </span><em>(white)</em></span> or sapphire crystals
        </span><em>(transparent),</em></span> which makes them virtually imperceptible
        to the naked eye. Another important difference to consider is the cost, since
        the aesthetic brackets of proven quality triple in value to those of stainless
        steel.</span></p>\n"
  - questions:
    - question: Are there other alternatives that are even more aesthetic?
      answer: '<p>At present there has been an impressive rebound of old techniques
        that were in disuse. Lingual Orthodontics and the so-called "invisible Orthodontics"
        without brackets, with pure plastic splints, are offered with excessive enthusiasm.
        We consider that they have great limitations and are only effective in some
        extremely simple cases, so they should be considered only under a very objective
        and professional criterion.</span></p>

'
    - question: Is it very uncomfortable to use brackets?
      answer: "<p>Usually the first 3 or 4 days following the installation of the
        braces are somewhat annoying because it is normal to experience some pain
        when eating and chewing. After this period, the inconveniences are usually
        limited to occasional minor discomforts, mainly caused by the friction of
        the appliances with the inner part of the lips and cheeks. For this you will
        be provided with a special wax that you must place on the bracket that is
        bothering you and thus solve the problem.</span></p>\n"
    - question: Is it necessary to place them on all teeth?
      answer: "<p>In the vast majority of cases yes. To obtain optimal results, it
        is also necessary to place bands </span><em>(metal rings)</em></span> around
        the molars, since these are the ones that provide the necessary anchorage
        to perform and control the vast majority of dental movements contemplated
        in the treatment planning phase.</span></p>\n"
    - question: Is it normal for teeth to stain or pigment around braces?
      answer: "<p>Not at all! Generally this is the first sign of a poorly performed
        treatment in which the excesses of adhesive were not removed when cementing
        the dispositives. These excesses are extremely harmful because in a short
        time they cause tooth decay, dental decalcification and severe gingival inflammation.</span></p>\n"
    - question: Is it necessary to have some kind of special care during treatment?
      answer: "<p>Of course that oral hygiene is a key factor for its success. It
        is essential to brush after each meal, use the interdental brush, floss and
        mouthwash. Periodic checks with the General Dentist, and in some cases with
        the Periodontist, are also recommended, so that teeth and gums remain healthy
        at all times.</span></p>\n"
    - question: What things can not be eaten with dental appliances?
      answer: "<p>You can practically eat everything, however, it is advisable to
        avoid some excessively hard foods such as ice and bones, and sticky like chewing
        gum, since they can easily detach brackets, bands and other devices.</span></p>\n"
    - question: How often are Orthodontic checks performed?
      answer: "<p>Generally every 4 weeks, except for special circumstances.</span></p>\n"
    - question: Will my teeth really look perfect?
      answer: "<p>In 99% of the cases the results obtained are completely satisfactory
        as long as the treatment is planned based on a right diagnosis and the patient
        regularly attends his control appointments. Sometimes it is necessary to complement
        these results with procedures of Dental Aesthetics, Whitening or Periodontal
        Plastic Surgery, so that the teeth look really spectacular.</span></p>\n"
    - question: Could they move after removing the braces?
      answer: "<p>Dental alignment is a dynamic and changing entity over time, that
        is, teeth tend to move throughout life, with or without prior orthodontics,
        so the retention phase is the longest and most complex of an orthodontic treatment
        and requires excellent collaboration by the patient.</span></p>\n"
    - question: What are the retainers and what are they for?
      answer: "<p>They are custom-made devices that are placed at the time of removing
        the brackets. They can be fixed or removable and are intended to keep the
        teeth in their final position, preventing them from moving and misaligning
        again. If they are removable, they are used 24 hours a day at the beginning,
        but then it is usually enough to put them only to sleep.</span></p>\n"
