    description: '<p class="dv-div-text text-left dv-numb-txt">The first 3 or 4 days
      after the installation of the brackets are somewhat uncomfortable because it
      is normal to experience some sensation of "burning or itching" in the gums and
      some pain or discomfort at the time of biting and chewing. Also, it is possible
      that ulcers, aphthas or sores appear inside the mouth <em>(remember that the
      appliances are a foreign body for your organism)</em>; mainly on the tongue,
      lips and cheeks. If necessary, you can take an analgesic such as acetaminophen
      or paracetamol and use the Orthodontic wax that we have provided; placing a
      small piece of it on the bracket that is bothering you.</p> '

      eat practically everything, but it is essential to avoid food and hard objects
      that could detach the devices or bend the wires; a situation that would cause
      significant delays in treatment. Therefore, do not touch the brackets with your
      fingers, pencils or pens; or bite your nails or use wooden chopsticks. All these
      habits could damage Orthodontic appliances. Also avoid biting foods directly,
      always cut or chop them first with your hands or cutlery before putting them
      in your mouth. Also avoid chewing gum or sticky foods and biting excessively
      hard things such as bone, ice, seeds and similar objects. IT IS JUST A MATTER
      OF COMMON SENSE!</p> '

    description: '<p class="dv-div-text text-left dv-numb-txt">During the treatment
      it is important to practice a very careful oral hygiene. The appliances cause
      more dental plaque and food debris to be retained in the teeth, therefore it
      is then necessary to devote some more time to their cleaning. If your teeth
      and gums do not brush well; they will swell, bleed and a bad smell will come
      out of your mouth.</p> '

            each meal <em>(normally, just as you did before having appliances)</em>,
            paying special attention to the area of the teeth between the braces and
            gums; as it is there where more food is retained. If for some reason you
            cannot do it, at least rinse thoroughly with plenty of water or mouthwash.
            Fluoride paste should be used and the brush changed regularly, when you
            notice that the bristles begin to bend and wear out.</p>

            and then use the interdental brush to access the space between teeth,
            wires and brackets. This small cone-shaped brush must be operated vertically,
            from the bottom up and between all the brackets and bands that you have
            in your mouth. Check that all spaces and appliances remain clean and free
            of food debris.</p>

            proximal surfaces of the teeth. Insert it directly above the wire arch,
            first hugging the surface of one tooth and then that of the other. If
            it is your desire, complement the process with the mouthwash of your preference.</p>

    text-left\">The complexity of removing oral biofilm <em>(bacterial plaque)</em>
    in highly retentive areas such like the ones that form with Orthodontic appliances
    can easily generate gingival inflammation, tooth decay and halitosis. A large
    number of clinical trials have shown that, under these conditions, Waterpik<sup>®</sup>
    oral irrigators eliminate 99.9% of plaque deposited on teeth, gums and hard-to-reach
    places; thanks to the direct application of a pulsatile jet of water or common
    mouthwash.</p> <p class=\"dv-div-text text-left\"> In our opinion, the Irrigation
    Technique will always be indicated as an adjunctive resource in the hygiene of
    patients with Orthodontics, Fixed Prosthesis and Dental Implants.</p><img src=\"https://dentalvip.com.ve/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cuide-sus-brackets-waterpik.jpg\"
