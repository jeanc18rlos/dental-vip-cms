  title: IMPLANT SUPPORTED RESTORATIONS
  content: '<p class="dv-subtitle text-center">There is a lot of types. The indication
    of one or the other will depend on the number of missing teeth, bone and gum volume,
    facial fullness, number and arrangement of the implants, aesthetic factors, occlusion,
    antagonistic arcade, prosthetic space and economic considerations.</p>

      it is the most basic restoration that can be made on a osseointegrated implant.

      3 or more contiguous teeth. The structure is made up of 3 or more crowns fused
      together and supported at its ends by 2 or more dental implants. They can be
      made with the same materials that are used for individual crowns.</p>

      of a single structure. This type of prosthesis is the most similar to natural
      dentition and when biting through it provides an unequaled sense of security
      and comfort; however, it requires a great economic investment and almost intact
      maxillary bone bases.</p>

      It is a single fixed structure that is screwed onto 4, 6 or 8 implants and usually
      replaces all the teeth of an arcade. It can be made of metal-porcelain or metal-acrylic,
      and that in cases of maxillary atrophy or severe bone resorption; it incorporates
      artificial pink gum to restore the occlusal vertical dimension, lip support,
      dental aesthetics and facial fullness of the person.</p>

      removable and that is anchored on 2, 3 or 4 implants. It is also known as "fit
      denture" because it is based on a male and female system for insertion and removal.
      The fact of being able to be removed by the patient considerably facilitates
      the process of oral hygiene, and although it is removable; the implants provide
      it great retention and stability compared to a conventional or muco-supported
      prosthesis.</p>

    title: Occlusal balance
    text: Without fear of being wrong, we can affirm that the occlusion we give to
      an implant-supported restoration, especially if it is fixed; will represent
      its life insurance. The implant does not have mechanisms or "fuse" sensors that
      allow it, in the event of an overload, to emit an alarm signal; as is the case
      with a natural tooth through the proprioceptive elements contained in its periodontium.
      Hence the importance of achieving a perfect occlusion or bite in all restorative
      treatments on osseointegrated implants.

  - title: Impression making
    text: It is the procedure that allows us to register, copy and reproduce in negative
      and with accuracy the artificial infra and mesostructures in order to obtain
      the working model for the manufacture of the definitive prosthesis. To rehabilitate
      implants we handle the concept of transfer and elastomeric materials such as
      silicones by addition.
  - title: Screwed or cemented prosthesis?
    text: It depends on the case. Each one has its specific indications and utilities.
      However, the appearance of new special cements for implantological use has done
      that, little by little; cemented prostheses gaining ground in the selection.
