  content: The use of Osseointegrated Dental Implants in the Oral Rehabilitation of
    partially or totally edentulous patients has been fully consolidated as a reliable
    and highly predictable alternative in the long term.
paragraphSection:
  body: "<p>Undoubtedly, one of the most spectacular advances of the modern dentistry
    is the development of Dental Implants. These <b>are small titanium devices in
    the form of a cylinder and that, due to their high degree of biocompatibility,
    are capable of osseointegrate into the maxillary structures to “ideally” replace
    teeth lost</b> due to decay, trauma and periodontal disease, thus avoiding the
    use of old ones removable prostheses.</p> <p>With the LAST GENERATION IMPLANTS
    <b>the surgical procedure of placement is quite simple, fast and painless.</b>
    However, it must always be performed by Specialists in Oral or Maxillofacial Surgery,
    since the technique to be used is quite sensitive and requires extensive surgical
    and anatomical knowledge of oral tissues and structures.</p> <p><b>Another essential
    factor in Advanced Implantology is the restorative aspect.</b> If the prosthesis
    that is then placed on the implant is not well designed, the harmful forces generated
    by chewing will inevitably lead to its failure. Hence the importance and necessity
    of MULTIDISCIPLINARY TREATMENT in Oral Rehabilitation with Osseointegrated Dental
    Implants. <b>In our clinic the second phase of the treatment or prosthetic phase
    is always in charge of the Prosthodontics Specialist Dentist</b>, since no one
    better than him is able to handle the complicated principles and foundations of
    occlusion physiology, that is to say, in the way that implant and prosthesis should
    related to the rest of the teeth when the patient comes into fuction to eat and
    chew.</p> <p>Finally, and in pro of the long-term success of the treatment, it
    is also imperative to highlight the importance of <b>complying with a good consensual
    periodontal maintenance protocol</b>, which at 12-month intervals, allows us to
    keep healthy gums and prosthetic elements in perfect aesthetic and structural
    condition.</p>\n"

  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  blocks:
  - questions:
    - question: What is osseointegration?
      answer: "<p>It is defined as the biological process by which a functional ankylosis
        is achieved between an implant and its recipient bone. The implants are made
        of titanium, biocompatible and osteoinducer metal, capable of stimulating
        osteoblast differentiation and initiating the process of healing and bone
        regeneration <em>(osteogenesis)</em> around it. This phenomenon is what allows
        an implant to fix firmly to the bone, remain stable over time and can be safely
        used as a base or pillar of dental prostheses.</p>\n"
    - question: When are Osseointegrated Dental Implants indicated?
      answer: "<p>When it is necessary to replace one, several or even all the teeth
        of the mouth. Unitary implants avoid the need to have to carve, wear and compromise
        the adjacent teeth that ones have been lost to make a traditional fixed bridge.
        We place an implant, a crown and ready, in this way a much more biological
        and conservative rehabilitation is achieved. When several or all of the teeth
        are missing, multiple implants are placed and then individual crowns or exclusively
        implant supported fixed prostheses are cemented or screwed on them.</p>\n"
    - question: Are there contraindications to implant treatment?
      answer: "<p>As a general rule, they are the same that prevent other surgical
        procedures such as blood clotting disorders, recent history of acute myocardial
        infarction or stroke, severe immunosuppression, malignant tumors undergoing
        chemotherapy or radiotherapy, severe rheumatoid arthritis, uncontrolled diabetes
        mellitus and bone diseases such as osteoporosis and osteomalacy. Also, it
        is important to assess other additional factors such as the intake of bisphosphonates
        in women, presence of acute periodontal infection and severe smoking habits.</p>\n"
    - question: So they are contraindicated in smokers?
      answer: "<p>Cigarette does not constitute an absolute contraindication for implant
        rehabilitation, however, it is scientifically proven that smoking causes peripheral
        vascular vasoconstriction that significantly alters the process of bone healing
        and regeneration. So that in these patients the chances of success are reduced
        from approximately 98% to 65% of cases.</p>\n"
    - question: How are they placed?
      answer: "<p>Through a small surgery, very little invasive, a perforation or
        surgical bed is created in the thickness of the alveolar bone. Next, the implant
        is introduced by screwing it under pressure so that its surface is in intimate
        contact with the underlying bone tissue. Making simple analogy we can say
        that the surgical phase is quite similar to the way of placing a ramplug on
        a wall. In some cases it is not even necessary to take stitches.</p>\n"
    - question: Is this procedure very painful?
      answer: "<p>Not at all, as long as it is performed under a proper local anesthetic
        technique. Our Oral Surgeon handles excellent surgical protocols and powerful
        anesthetics that make the procedure simple, fast and painless. The postoperative
        period is usually very similar to a dental extraction.</p>\n"
    - question: Any prerequisites for the intervention?
      answer: "<p>Almost the same as for any other oral surgery act. Good general
        health, a preoperative profile that assesses the ability of coagulation and
        tissue scarring and prophylactic premedication with broad-spectrum antibiotics,
        usually amoxicillin with clavulanic acid or cephalosporins in allergic patients.</p>\n"
    - question: Other special surgeries may be necessary?
      answer: "<p>Unfortunately, in some cases the quantity, quality and density of
        the recipient bone may be deficient and it is usually necessary to place autogenous
        or synthetic bone grafts to improve the local environment and avoid a possible
        failure. Another relatively common maneuver is the elevation of the maxillary
        sinus or SINUS LIFT, since many times its descent or pneumatization limits
        the placement of implants in the posterior sector of the upper jaw.</p>\n"
    - question: Are all implants the same?
      answer: |
        <p>No, they vary considerably in diameter, length, conicity, type of connection and surface treatment. Previous radiographic studies, conical beam volumetric tomography <em>(Cone Beam)</em> and the Surgeon's clinical experience are key factors for your choice. Likewise, it is important to use trademarks recognized and backed by long-term research studies that guarantee their performance and functional longevity. In our clinic, and according to their level of quality, we offer you medium-high and high-end dental implants.</p>
        <p>We do not work with low cost or clonic implants!</p>
    - question: What are immediate implants?
      answer: "<p>They are those that are placed at the same time of dental extraction
        to avoid resorption of the alveolar ridge and favor the aesthetic results
        of the final restoration. An additional advantage is that they significantly
        shorten the total treatment time, since it is not necessary to wait for the
        4 or 5 months involved in the process of bone healing and neoformation of
        the dental alveolus after extraction.</p>\n"
  - questions:
    - question: Are Dental Implants very expensive?
      answer: "<p>Expensive is something that implies giving an overestimated value
        to something that does not have it. Although by their nature <em>(pure titanium)</em>
        implants are more expensive than other dental alternatives, the fact of being
        able to eat and smile practically as with natural teeth makes them deserving
        of the highest value in any cost-benefit relationship.</p>\n"
    - question: What is an All-on-Four system?
      answer: "<p>It is a technique that allows the total fixed rehabilitation with
        implants in the upper or lower jaw of the fully edentulous patient. It is
        based on the strategic placement of only four implants, a fact that considerably
        reduces the final costs of the treatment.</p>\n"
    - question: How aesthetic do implants look?
      answer: "<p>The implants are not visible, they are embedded inside the bone,
        so that the aesthetic responsibility lies with the definitive prosthesis.
        This should be made to meet all relevant functional requirements, and also
        to provide the patient with teeth that look truly natural, of a color, shape
        and size that project harmony and proportionality, individually characterized
        and capable of reflecting and translucent light. These are all key factors
        for the aesthetic success of the treatment.</p>\n"
    - question: What is the prosthetic phase?
      answer: "<p>It is the second phase of a rehabilitation with Dental Implants.
        It must always be in charge of the Prosthodontics Specialist, who will design,
        prepare and install the definitive implant-supported prosthesis, always fully
        respecting all biomechanical principles of occlusion and dental aesthetics.
        Individual crowns, fixed bridges, complete rehabilitations, hybrid prostheses
        and overdentures are the known alternatives.</p>\n"
    - question: Are all implant prostheses fixed?
      answer: "<p>Although it is possible to make removable overdentures, we consider
        that the effort and investment involved in this type of procedure deserves
        a fixed prosthesis that truly improves the quality of life of the person.
        In our clinic, whenever possible, we try to make them all fixed, with the
        exception of the provisional ones used during the osseointegration period.</p>\n"
    - question: Can the crown or fixed prosthesis be placed immediately, that is,
        on the same day as the surgery?
      answer: "<p>Yes we can with the so-called immediate loading implants, however,
        for this we must meet a series of ideal conditions sometimes difficult to
        find. The traditional and even more common protocol is that of deferred load,
        which includes a period of 3-4 months of waiting between the surgical and
        prosthetic phases to allow complete maturation of the peri-implant bone tissue
        <em>(osseointegration)</em>. During that period a removable provisional prosthesis
        is usually made to temporarily solve the aesthetic problem.</p>\n"
    - question: Is it a definitive treatment, for a lifetime?
      answer: "<p>It would be irresponsible to offer a general estimate for all cases,
        however, there are patients who have been implant prostheses for more than
        30 years. Obviously everything depends on the general state of health, prior
        planning of the case, surgical implantation technique, device quality, aseptic
        procedure, correct distribution of masticatory loads, oral hygiene, patient
        habits and, very important; assistance to subsequent periodic reviews to rule
        out or treat on time incipient infectious processes, mismatches or failures
        of prosthetic components.</p>\n"
    - question: Is there a possibility of rejection of a Dental Implant?
      answer: "<p>There is no described cases of allergy or toxicity to titanium in
        the literature, so there can be no rejection itself. It may happen that an
        implant is not properly osseointegrated by an infectious process or localized
        trauma <em>(usually by a premature or poorly developed prosthesis)</em> and
        it is necessary to replace it with another one to solve the problem. The success
        rate today, with High-End Dental Implants, is greater than 98% of cases.</p>\n"
    - question: What is peri-implantitis?
      answer: "<p>Implants and natural teeth are so similar that they are susceptible
        to the same periodontal diseases. Just as there is periodontitis, there is
        peri-implantitis, both bacterial and inflammatory diseases that destroy the
        alveolar bone, cause mobility of teeth and implants, and in extreme cases;
        loss of them.</p>\n"
    - question: How then to prevent it?
      answer: "<p>The first thing is to make sure the preparation and capacity of
        the professionals who will carry out your treatment. For this you do not need
        a dentist, you need a WORK TEAM consisting of a Surgeon, a Prosthodontist
        and a Periodontist who dominate and have experience in the field. Then, your
        collaboration is indispensable. Oral hygiene is the fundamental pillar of
        any restorative procedure in Dentistry, and implants are no exception. If
        you achieve always keep your implants and gums free of dental plaque and food
        debris, go regularly to regular control appointments and keep yourself in
        good general health, it is very likely that you will enjoy for a lifetime
        the benefits of this Innovative Dental Alternative.</p>\n"
