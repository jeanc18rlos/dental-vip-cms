  content: If indicated, a Root Canal Treatment performed on time is the only viable
    alternative to avoid odontectomy or extraction of a compromised tooth.
paragraphSection:
  body: |
    <p>Any stimulus or aggressive entity capable of compromising the structural integrity of a tooth is also capable of causing damage, infection or necrosis of its pulp tissue. <b>The dental pulp or "nerve" of a tooth is a specialized connective tissue that is lodged internally throughout the crown and root</b>. When a trauma, excessive dental wear or indiscriminate advance of an untreated caries reaches, exposes or infects that pulp tissue, and of course we want to preserve the dental organ; there is no alternative but to <b>remove it, disinfect and then mechanically widen the empty root canals so that they are capable of receiving an inert, sterile and biocompatible filling material</b> that completely occupies them, avoids pain and the spread of the infectious process. In this consist a ROOT CANAL TREATMENT. <b>If it is not performed on time, large facial abscesses, phlegmones or extremely painful and aggressive cellulite processes can be formed</b> that can spread rapidly and seriously compromise other vital structures of the orofacial region, and in extreme cases; until the patient's life.</p>
    <p>Given how intricate and variable the root anatomy of the teeth is and the fact that the canals are small cavities inaccessible to the human eye, <b>it is a considerably hostile and difficult field of work</b>, therefore it is necessary for the Dentist to have extensive anatomical knowledge of the RADICULAR MORPHOLOGY and has developed a very special sense of tactile perception that allows him to <b>locate, access, instrument and fill the canals with great precision, with no margin of error possible</b>. It is our opinion that such qualities are only achieved through formal studies of the Specialty and limiting professional practice exclusively to the area of Endodontics. </p>
    <p><b>Our Endodontist has the latest technological advances such as high-speed rotary systems for mechanical canal instrumentation</b>, electronic root apex locator, computerized digital radiology or RADIOVISIOGRAPHY that minimizes the emission of x-rays and modern thermoplastic shutter systems that reduce almost to zero the rates of clinical failure and the need for retreatments, periapical endodontic surgeries, apicectomies and dental extractions.</p>

  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  blocks:
  - questions:
    - question: How is a tooth inside?
      answer: "<p>It is conformed in all its extension by a cavity or space that lodges
        a “nerve” or pulp tissue, and that is divided in two portions; the coronary
        and the radicular. The coronary portion is called the pulp chamber and houses
        the coronary pulp. The radicular portion is called the root canal, extends
        to the end or apex of the root and is also occupied by specialized connective
        tissue or dental pulp.</p>\n"
    - question: How many roots and canals do they have?
      answer: "<p>There are monoradicular, biradicular and multiradicular teeth. According
        to the position they occupy in the archway they usually have one, two or three
        roots. Within each root there may be one or two canals.</p>\n"
    - question: How to know if a root canal is needed?
      answer: "<p>Generally by the symptomatology. Spontaneous pain, constant hypersensitivity
        to thermal stimuli, discomfort from sugar intake and the presence of dental
        abscesses are usually clear hints of pulpitis and/or pulp necrosis.</p>\n"
    - question: What is a pulpitis?
      answer: "<p>It is the inflammation of the dental pulp. It can be reversible
        or irreversible. It is considered irreversible when, despite being vital,
        the pulp has completely lost its regeneration capacity.</p>\n"
    - question: What is a pulp necrosis?
      answer: "<p>It is the death of the nerve of a tooth as a final consequence of
        a chronic, very acute or traumatic inflammation of its pulp tissue. Generally,
        the process begins at the most coronal fraction of the pulp and then extends
        to its root portion.</p>\n"
    - question: Can a root canal treatment be performed in the presence of acute pain
        or inflammation?
      answer: "<p>Many times it is difficult. It is often necessary to prescribe antibiotics,
        analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs before accessing the canals. In other
        cases, it becomes pertinent to drain abscesses and treat other apical processes
        as a prerequisite for root therapy.</p>\n"
    - question: How many sessions are needed to complete a conventional endodontics?
      answer: "<p>It depends on several factors. From the symptomatology, whether
        it is live pulp or dead pulp, whether there is or not a presence of exudate
        and the number of roots and canals to be treated; among others. As a general
        rule, treatments are completed in one, two or three clinical sessions.</p>\n"
    - question: Is there any other alternative to endodontic therapy?
      answer: "<p>Tooth extraction only.</p>\n"
    - question: Is it necessary to place anesthesia?
      answer: "<p>Of course! They are usually infected, inflamed or necrotic tissues,
        highly sensitive to clinical manipulation. Fortunately, a good previous diagnosis
        and an adequate technique of truncal or infiltrative local anesthesia will
        be sufficient to carry out the procedure without major discomfort for the
        patient.</p>\n"
    - question: Why is it always recommended to isolate the tooth to be treated with
        a rubber dam?
      answer: |
        <p>
          The absolute isolation of the operative field allows to maintain at all times the conditions of asepsis and facilitates the procedures of antisepsis. In addition to preventing the entry of saliva <em>(substance rich in bacteria)</em> into the canals, the rubber dam improves the visibility of the area and prevents the patient from aspirating or swallowing instruments and chemicals substances during the treatment.</p>
  - questions:
    - question: What is conductometry?
      answer: "<p>It consists in determining the exact length between the apical constriction
        of each canal and the incisal edge or occlusal surface of the tooth being
        treated. This measure constitutes the length of work and must be respected
        at all times to avoid complications and therapeutic failures.</p>\n"
    - question: What are the objectives of instrumentation or biomechanical preparation?
      answer: "<p>Remove the pulp, remove residues and necrotic material, widen the
        canal and give it a conical shape for your complete disinfection and adequate
        filling.</p>\n"
    - question: What materials are used to fill or seal off the empty root canals?
      answer: "<p>Throughout history, a wide variety of materials have been used for
        this purpose, however, none has been shown to meet all desirable requirements
        of the ideal material. At present, gutta-percha remains the most used, a type
        of polymer substance similar to rubber and that is extracted from a tree originating
        from the islands of the Malay archipelago. Additionally, a cement is placed
        that guarantees apical sealing, usually based on calcium hydroxide.</p>\n"
    - question: How to know if a root canal treatment was correctly performed?
      answer: "<p>Basically due to the absence of symptoms and radiographic evidence.
        A well-performed root canal treatment should reflect a filling that extends
        until the apical constriction of the root, that lacks lights inside, that
        has sufficient body and volume, that is compact in all its extension and that
        faithfully reproduces the conical shape of the canal it occupies.</p>\n"
    - question: What complications could occur?
      answer: "<p>If the Specialist is not well trained and attentive to his work,
        he could widen the root walls excessively and weaken the tooth, he could fracture
        instruments inside the canal, he could create steps and false pathways, coronary,
        cameral or root perforations, he could boost necrotic or organic remains to
        the periapice and generate sub or overobturations.</p>\n"
    - question: What is an overobturation?
      answer: "<p>It consists of extravasation of a small amount of sealant or gutta-percha
        into the periradicular area, outside the root of the tooth. Fortunately, numerous
        scientific articles support the success of the treatment even in cases where
        there has been a small over-sealing.</p>\n"
    - question: What is an endodontic retreatment?
      answer: "<p>Root canal re-treatment is the intervention that is carried out
        to eliminate the filling material that is inside the canals of a tooth already
        treated for its new cleaning, shaping and filling. In other words, it is a
        new root canal treatment in a previously treated tooth.</p>\n"
    - question: When should it be done?
      answer: "<p>When for some reason the initial endodontic therapy has failed,
        or when the canals have become contaminated again. Such circumstance usually
        occurs when the definitive restoration is not made as soon as possible, when
        new caries appear, in cases of advanced periodontal disease or when the tooth
        cracks and suffers a small fracture. Any of these situations could lead to
        a reinfection.</p>\n"
    - question: Are teeth that have undergone root canal treatment more fragile?
      answer: "<p>Undoubtedly! The loss of tooth coronal structure and pulp mechanoreceptors
        make them less flexible, less resistant and more susceptible to fracture.
        That is why its permanence and longevity will depend on its adequate and immediate
        reconstruction.</p>\n"
    - question: How long can I stay without the definitive restoration?
      answer: "<p>The shortest possible time. As long as an endodontic treated tooth
        is not restored, it will be prone to fracture and reinfection. In those cases
        of great destruction, which merit the manufacture of artificial posts and
        cores, we recommend starting the root preparation two or three days after
        the endodontics is finished.</p>\n"
