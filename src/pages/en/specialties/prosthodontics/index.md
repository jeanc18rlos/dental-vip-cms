  content: The psychological consequences associated to the Absence of Teeth generate
    a lot of insecurity in people and behavioral changes capable of limiting, and
    even destroying; their social, emotional and labor relationships.
paragraphSection:
  body: "<p>It is well known that the integrity of the dental arches is a key factor
    in maintaining the balance and correct functioning of the entire STOMATOGNATHIC
    SYSTEM conformed by teeth, jaws, masticatory muscles and temporomandibular joints.
    <strong>If one or more teeth are lost and are not replaced as soon as possible,
    the pieces adjacent to the empty spaces are inclined and move towards them altering
    the occlusion and masticatory function</strong>. In addition, new spaces can begin
    to appear between the anterior teeth <em>(diastemas)</em> that seriously compromise
    dental aesthetics.</p> <p><strong>Prosthodontics is undoubtedly one of the Specialties
    with greater range of action within current Dentistry.</strong> It can encompass
    from the reconstruction of a single partially destroyed tooth to bimaxillary COMPLETE
    REHABILITATION in totally edentulous patients.</p> <p>Within the prosthetic arsenal
    at our disposal we find the well-known and popular removable dentures, conventional
    fixed prostheses and the <strong>sophisticated implant-supported restorations</strong>.
    Without any discussion, the last are currently, in all their types and versions;
    the ones of first choice. Although the function has traditionally been the primary
    objective of the Prosthodontist, nowadays aesthetics have the same relevance and
    trends have led us to make <strong>totally aesthetic and metal-free devices </strong>such
    as the thermoplastic nylon flexible prostheses Valplast<sup>®</sup> type and the
    <strong>impressive crowns and bridges of Zirconia or Lithium Disilicate</strong>
    made with CAD-CAM COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY.</p> <p>Said the above, it is not difficult
    to understand <strong>the importance it has of the participation of a Specialist,
    </strong>of a Prosthodontist who guarantees the aesthetic and functional success
    of his restorative treatment, who be really capable to design and manufacture
    prosthetic devices that allow you to speak, eat and smile comfortably and without
    any type of limitation.</p>\n"

  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  blocks:
  - questions:
    - question: What is a dental prosthesis?
      answer: "<p>It is an anatomical device that simulates or contains artificial
        teeth that replace the crowns of very destroyed, absents or missing natural
        teeth. Depending on their extension they can be individual, partial or total;
        and according to its support and retention, fixed or removable.</p>\n"
    - question: Why are gums health so important for any prosthetic device?
      answer: "<p>The durability of any type of prosthesis will depend on its structural
        integrity and the health of its pillars. Regardless of whether they are supported
        by natural teeth, stumps or dental implants, they are all anchored and retained
        by the support periodontal tissues; by the bone tissue and gum mainly. If
        there is not good hygiene, they could become infected, inflamed, reabsorb
        the alveolar bone, loosen and fall the pillars; to finally, lose the dental
        prosthesis prematurely.</p>\n"
    - question: How long does it take to make a dental prosthesis?
      answer: "<p>It depends a lot on the case and type of rehabilitation. The lapses
        can vary from 2 or 3 days for provisional ones to 6 or 7 months for those
        that are manufactured over implants, of course, taking into account the osseointegration
        period. As a general rule and under normal conditions, 3 weeks is the average
        period of time required to do tests and complete the vast majority of our
        definitive restorations; whether fixed or removable.</p>\n"
    - question: How is a conventional removable prosthesis?
      answer: "<p>They are &ldquo;remove and put&rdquo; devices that can be inserted
        and removed by the patient, rest on the oral mucosa, and if they are partial;
        are retained with hooks that surround some natural teeth. They are usually
        made with chromium-cobalt metal alloys, thermopolymerizable acrylic resin
        and thermoplastic nylon by injection. Due to their great aesthetic and functional
        limitations we only indicate them as provisional or transitional structures
        in extensive rehabilitations, or definitive; only in those cases where really
        no other alternative applies.</p>\n"
    - question: What care should be taken with such a denture?
      answer: "<p>Periodic professional controls and scrupulous oral hygiene to avoid
        periodontal diseases and caries in the support teeth, particularly in the
        areas where the hooks are located. It is also necessary to clean the prosthesis
        after each meal, using a soft bristle brush and toothpaste. We always recommend
        removing the denture to sleep, so that the oral support mucosa has an opportunity
        for revascularization and regeneration, essential biological phenomena to
        prevent the occurrence and recurrence of inflammatory, degenerative or infectious
        lesions.</p>\n"
    - question: When should a "remove and put" denture be replaced?
      answer: "<p>When any of its structural components is fractured, when some pillar
        is lost, when the reabsorption of the basal bone that supports it is noticeable
        or when its necessary periodic adjustments are not able to guarantee its stability
        and retention. We must understand that traditional removable dentures are
        very poor from the biomechanical point of view, they always generate undesirable
        forces on the anchor teeth and cause resorption of their supporting tissues;
        all circumstances that considerably limit their longevity or useful life.</p>\n"
    - question: How is a tooth-supported fixed prosthesis?
      answer: "<p>The classic fixed prosthesis is cemented to the remaining natural
        teeth, previously worn and turned into stumps. They usually consist of a porcelain
        coated metal core, although it is currently possible to make them from pure
        ceramics or upon a white core based on Zirconia. Generally, due to their greater
        naturalness and translucency, the total-ceramic structures are indicated for
        the anterior teeth and, due to their greater resistance, those the metal core
        for the posterior ones.</p>\n"
    - question: What is a stump in Dentistry?
      answer: "<p>It is a natural tooth that has been carved and worn to serve as
        a pillar to a crown or conventional fixed prosthesis. When the remaining dental
        structure is scarce or weakened, it will be necessary to make an &ldquo;artificial
        stump&rdquo; that consists of two portions, a radicular post that is housed
        inside the root canal <em>(endodontic treated and desobturated previously)</em>
        and a coronal portion that replaces to the dentin lost and reinforces the
        existing one. Artificial stumps <em>(post and core)</em> can be made with
        fiberglass-based materials or by foundry and casting of high-strength metal
        alloys.</p>\n"
    - question: And stumps carving does not harm teeth?
      answer: "<p>It depends on the case. If the teeth are already very decayed or
        fractured, on the contrary, the carving and subsequent reconstruction of the
        stump will reinforce them, allow their aesthetic restoration and guarantee
        their permanence in the mouth. It would be different if we had to carve completely
        healthy teeth with the sole purpose of replacing other absent teeth using
        conventional fixed prostheses. Today the main advantage of dental implants
        is that they allow us to keep intact the neighboring teeth to the edentulous
        spaces.</p>\n"
    - question: Is it always necessary to perform a root canal before carving a stump?
      answer: "<p>Not always, but in the vast majority of cases. The mechanical drilling
        applied to a vital tooth to wear it and turn it into a stump constitutes a
        great physical aggression and generates so much friction and heat that usually,
        and in the short or medium term, it causes irreversible inflammation, degeneration
        and death of its pulp tissue; always accompanied by extreme sensitivity and
        pain. Such a condition would put the permanent fixed restorations at risk,
        since they would then have to be detached or perforated to endodontically
        treat their pillars. Preventive endodontics for prosthetic reasons is currently
        a widely accepted clinical criterion worldwide.</p>\n"
  - questions:
    - question: How many types of porcelain are used in fixed prosthodontics?
      answer: "<p>Chemically, porcelains or dental ceramics can be grouped into three
        large families: feldspathic, aluminous and zirconia based. The feldspats of
        vitreous matrix <em>(based on feldspar and quartz) </em>are the most aesthetic
        but most fragile of all, so they are mainly used for the coating of metal
        or ceramic skeletons. The aluminous <em>(with a high content of aluminum oxide)
        </em>are very resistant but very opaque and not very aesthetic, which is why
        they are currently reserved only for the preparation of copings and internal
        structures, being necessary to cover them with porcelains of less alumina
        for achieve a good mimicry with the natural tooth. Zirconia ceramics are the
        most novel and are composed of highly sintered zirconium oxide <em>(ZrO<sub>2</sub>),</em>
        which makes them highly resistant to flexion and fracture, and therefore,
        the ideal materials for making ceramic prostheses in areas of high mechanical
        compromise. However, like high-strength aluminous, these ceramics are very
        opaque <em>(they do not have a vitreous phase),</em> and therefore they are
        used only to manufacture the core of the restoration, that is to say; they
        must also be covered with conventional porcelains to achieve a good aesthetic
        result.</p>\n"
    - question: Are fixed prostheses for a lifetime?
      answer: "<p>Influence so many, but so many factors in the longevity of a fixed
        rehabilitation that no professional is able to predict, for sure, its duration
        in years. We consider that in favorable conditions, between 15 and 20 years
        is on average the useful life time for the vast majority of cases. Once the
        cycle has been completed, the rehabilitation may be ideally replaced by dental
        implants, or failing that, replicated; as long as the pillars offer favorable
        conditions for it.</p>\n"
    - question: What cares should be taken with a fixed prosthesis?
      answer: "<p>Scrupulous oral hygiene, common sense to avoid improperly biting
        excessively hard objects, permanent use of a protective night splint and periodic
        professional controls. It is essential, apart from normal brushing, the constant
        use of the interdental brush, special dental floss, mouthwash and oral irrigator.
        A Waterpik<sup>®</sup> is the best complement for oral hygiene of people with
        dental implants, fixed prosthesis and orthodontics. We always recommend to
        our patients a routine check every 6 or 12 months to verify the splint and
        evaluate their periodontal condition, occlusal function, stability, integrity
        and marginal sealing of the restorations.</p>\n"
    - question: How is special dental floss for prostheses?
      answer: "<p>It usually consists of 3 portions. A first rigid section to be inserted
        directly below the prosthesis, a second spongy section to clean around the
        restoration, between pillars and between the interdental spaces; and a third
        section without wax to remove the plaque from the gingival sulcus.</p>\n"
    - question: How is an implant-assisted or implant-supported restoration?
      answer: "<p>It is the one that is retained exclusively by dental implants. There
        are several types and they are basically made with the same materials as traditional
        prostheses. Structurally they are designed under a male-female connection
        system, in which the implants house the abutments or prosthetic pillars inside
        them, and over these; we fit, cement or screw the artificial teeth.</p>\n"
    - question: Why are prostheses over dental implants better?
      answer: "<p>In essence because they are totally independent, self-sufficient
        structures and that are closest to the ideal prosthetic prototype. They do
        not rest or retain on the patient's natural teeth, do not compromise them,
        do not generate harmful forces or functional overloads, and consequently;
        replace lost teeth without any negative effect on present ones, a condition
        impossible to achieve with any type of conventional prosthesis. In addition,
        it is the only fixed alternative for those patients who have lost all or most
        of their teeth.</p>\n"
    - question: How many types of implant-supported restorations are there?
      answer: "<p>In essence, 3 types: fixed of metal-porcelain or total ceramic,
        hybrids of metal-acrylic or metal-porcelain and removable overdentures. In
        the DENTAL IMPLANTS section you can find a very specific description of each
        of them and their variants.</p>\n"
    - question: Which is better, work over a restorable tooth root or replace it at
        once whit a dental implant?
      answer: "<p>Whenever possible we should preserve natural teeth. Although dental
        implants currently represent a high quality restorative alternative, they
        will never exceed the biological properties and functional expectations of
        a well-rehabilitated natural piece. When a single tooth has suffered a fracture
        or great destruction of its clinical crown due to caries, but its root preserves
        good integrity, favorable length and adequate periodontal support; it will
        always be preferable, and without any discussion; its treatment and restoration
        with endodontics, post and core and porcelain crown.</p>\n"
    - question: But, how do we know if a natural tooth can be successfully restored?
      answer: "<p>Studying the case thoroughly through intraoral examination, radiographic
        evaluation and a lot of clinical criterion. Everything will depend on the
        periapical conditions that it presents, on the amount of tooth tissue remaining,
        on its periodontal state, on its aesthetic requirements, on its root morphology,
        on its location in the dental arch, on the occlusal loads to which it will
        be exposed and on the whether it will work as an individual crown or as a
        fixed bridge pillar.</p>\n"
    - question: Can conventional prostheses be replaced by dental implants?
      answer: "<p>Of course yes, and it is in fact the most advisable to protect the
        natural teeth that remain in the mouth, but of course; as long as the patient's
        general health allows it, let us have enough maxillary bone for the pretended
        implantation and the person is willing to make a new effort and a new investment
        in time and money.</p>\n"
