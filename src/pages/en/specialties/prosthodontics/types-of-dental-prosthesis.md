      <h2 class="dv-div-title">Implant-supported prosthesis</h2>

      <p class="dv-srv-pr">Is the one that is made on dental implants and it is, in the vast majority of cases, the ideal type of prosthesis. Implants allow
      us to elaborate fixed and individualized restorations without having to carve,
      wear and compromise other healthy teeth. In addition, it is the only fixed alternative
      in cases of edentulous gaps without posterior pillars, small amount or total
      absence of remaining teeth.</p>

        <h2 class="dv-div-title">Tooth-supported prosthesis</h2>
        <p class="dv-srv-pr">It is also known as conventional fixed prosthesis
        and is cemented on the teeth adjacent to the empty space. It was undoubtedly
        the best option before the appearance of dental implants. For its elaborate
        it is necessary to carve stumps and wear the teeth that will it serve as a base
        <em>(pillars)</em> at each end, even when they are intact and completely healthy.</p>

      <h2 class="dv-div-title">Dento-muco-supported prosthesis</h2>
      <p class="dv-srv-pr">It is a removable partial denture made of acrylic
      <em>(plastic material)</em>, metal-acrylic or thermoplastic nylon. It can be
      inserted and removed by the patient himself. It rests on the oral mucosa and
      is retained by a system of extracoronal elements or hooks that surround some
      of the teeth still present. Although due to its aesthetic and functional limitations
      it moves away from the ideal prosthetic prototype, it still having valid as
      a provisional denture, and even definitive; in cases of surgical contraindication
      or economic limitation.</p>

      <h2 class="dv-div-title">Muco-supported prosthesis</h2>
      <p class="dv-srv-pr">It is the popular "complete denture" and is still
      used when there is no tooth left in the mouth. It has very little retention
      and stability, although some people get used to and tolerate it. There is currently
      the possibility of anchoring it to 2, 3 or 4 implants to transform it into a
      more comfortable and functional implant-assisted overdenture, of course, as
      long as the patient''s bone and systemic conditions allow it.</p>

      <p class="dv-div-text
      dv-pb-15">We believe that the routine of
      wearing out or overloading healthy teeth with the sole intention of replacing
      other absent ones, should already be a thing of the past. Compromise the health,
      integrity and longevity of its pillars, as it happens with the various variants
      of the conventional prosthesis, it was the price forced to pay before the discovery
      and development of osseointegration. </p> <p class="dv-div-text text-right">We
      are convinced that, under favorable conditions, the implants are the ideal and
      biological solution par excellence in the field of Oral Rehabilitation. In addition
      to replacing teeth, they preserve the maxillary bone and prevent the appearance
      of new pathologies in the remaining natural dentition.</p>
