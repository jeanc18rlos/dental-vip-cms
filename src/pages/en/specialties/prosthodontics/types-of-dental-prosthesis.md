      is, in the vast majority of cases; the ideal type of prosthesis. Implants allow
      us to elaborate fixed and individualized restorations without having to carve,
      wear and compromise other healthy teeth. In addition, it is the only fixed alternative
      in cases of edentulous gaps without posterior pillars, small amount or total
      absence of remaining teeth.</p>

      and is cemented on the teeth adjacent to the empty space. It was undoubtedly
      the best option before the appearance of dental implants. For its elaborate

      <em>(plastic material)</em>, metal-acrylic or thermoplastic nylon. It can be
      inserted and removed by the patient himself. It rests on the oral mucosa and
      is retained by a system of extracoronal elements or hooks that surround some
      of the teeth still present. Although due to its aesthetic and functional limitations
      it moves away from the ideal prosthetic prototype, it still having valid as
      a provisional denture; and even definitive, in cases of surgical contraindication
      or economic limitation.</p>

      used when there is no tooth left in the mouth. It has very little retention
      and stability, although some people get used to and tolerate it. There is currently
      the possibility of anchoring it to 2, 3 or 4 implants to transform it into a
      more comfortable and functional implant-assisted overdenture, of course; as
      long as the patient''s bone and systemic conditions allow it.</p>
