    carry out a clean, safe, fast and accurate intervention with hardly any postoperative
    sequel.
paragraphSection:
  body: "<p>Although the mouth represents a small and limited region of the human
    body, <b>a large number of congenital and/or acquired pathological entities that
    require elective surgical treatment</b> can be presented in it. Among the most
    common of those that are treated in our clinic we can mention the extraction of
    the included third molars  <em>(wisdom teeth)</em>, simple, complex and multiple
    dental extractions; placement of DENTAL IMPLANTS, phrenilectomies, apicectomies
    and periapical surgeries, excision and biopsy of minor oral lesions and dentigerous
    cysts; among others.</p>\n<p><b>Usually all these procedures are performed under
    local anesthesia;</b> however, they are occasionally executed in conjunction with
    an Anesthesiologist under CONSCIOUS SEDATION, especially in excessively nervous
    patients or with any physical or emotional commitment. <b>Its objective is to
    get people into a state of tranquility and deep relaxation during the clinical
    act.</b></p>\n<p><b>Although the purpose of the intervention may vary, the techniques
    used are always very similar; </b>  and involve, prior anesthesia, the gum incision,
    its detachment to a greater or lesser extent, the removal of pathological or excessive
    tissues, placement of implants or biocompatible grafts, and finally; the closure
    and suture of the wound. It will always be essential, for the final success of
    the procedure, that the operator knows in detail the specific function and clinical
    application of the numerous surgical instruments of DIERESIS, EXERESIS and SYNTHESIS.</p>\n<p><b>Oral
    Surgery is science, art and skill, </b> and although it is governed by the same
    principles of general surgery; it has its own peculiarities that emanate from
    the anatomical area to be treated. Not in vain, <b>it is the oldest Specialty
    of Dentistry.</b></p> \n"

  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  blocks:
  - questions:
    - question: Why choose a Specialist in Oral Surgery?
      answer: "<p>Because he is a broad connoisseur of oral anatomy and pathology,
        because he exercises great mastery over contemporary medical-surgical principles
        and because he possesses great skill and dexterity on handling the most innovative
        clinical techniques of the Specialty; qualities that confer him the level
        of expert in the matter.</p>\n"
    - question: Are surgical acts performed in the mouth very painful?
      answer: "<p>The evolution that Dentistry has experienced in recent decades allows
        us to affirm that, under normal conditions, the discomfort associated with
        any surgical act is truly small. Although all Oral Surgery procedures are
        essentially invasive, the reality is that the postoperative period is perfectly
        controllable. The application of an effective anesthetic technique, of a controlled
        surgical act and the adoption of an adequate postoperative protocol; will
        minimize the risk and the possibility of pain, infection and inflammation
        of the affected area.</p>\n"
    - question: Is it necessary to undergo to blood tests before an intervention?
      answer: "<p>Although surgical complications are extremely rare in young and
        apparently healthy patients, it will never hurt to have a preoperative hematological
        profile that evaluates the ability of blood coagulation and tissue scarring.
        So a blood test will be routine as a prerequisite to the intervention.</p>\n"
    - question: Should the patient go on an empty stomach?
      answer: "<p>Conversely! If the procedure is going to be performed under local
        anesthesia, we should always avoid it. Fasting is only necessary in cases
        of general anesthesia.</p>\n"
    - question: What others preoperative cares are recommended?
      answer: "<p>We generally suggest using fresh and light clothes during the procedure,
        brushing carefully your teeth, gums and mucous membranes before the intervention;
        and having an adult companion who can provide you the necessary support.</p>\n"
    - question: For an Oral Surgery, could you give me general anesthesia?
      answer: "<p>Only in cases of Major Surgery such as Orthognathic and Maxillofacial.
        Due to its great effectiveness, safety and almost absolute absence of side
        effects; local trunk or infiltrative anesthesia is the one of choice for minor
        Oral Surgery interventions in outpatient settings. Conscious sedation with
        benzodiazepine derivatives is the best option for special or excessively apprehensive
        people; however, it requires the participation of an Anesthesiologist.</p>\n"
    - question: What is an atraumatic extraction and what is its importance?
      answer: "<p>Atraumatic surgical methods for tooth extraction aim to preserve
        intact the bone that surrounds the tooth root. This work philosophy is based
        on a set of very well defined principles and an instruments specially designed
        to preserve the alveolus and its bone crest, thus favoring the subsequent
        placement of dental implants. In oral implantology the bone is pure gold,
        and if there is bone, we have to take care of it.</p>\n"
    - question: When removing a tooth, can an implant be placed immediately?
      answer: "<p>Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The immediate implants are inserted
        in the same surgical act in which the extractions of the teeth to be replaced
        are performed. Although they are very desirable and offer great advantages,
        they cannot be placed in the presence of extensive apical lesions and/or active
        periodontal pathology.</p>\n"
    - question: Is it always necessary to extract the third molars or wisdom teeth?
      answer: "<p>Definitely not! They should be removed when they are unable to erupt
        due to lack of space and remain included, when generate pain or chronic discomfort,
        when erupt in a bad position, when interfere with occlusion or bite or when
        they suffer carious lesions of considerable extent.</p>\n"
    - question: What are included teeth?
      answer: "<p> Dental inclusion is a developmental disorder in which a given tooth,
        come the normal time of its eruption, remains inside the tissues of the oral
        cavity <em>(alveolar bone and oral mucosa)</em>. The teeth that most frequently
        suffer from this situation are the third molars <em>(wisdom teeth)</em>, mainly
        those of the lower jaw. The diagnosis of the inclusion of a tooth can only
        be made using radiological examinations, usually a panoramic dental x-ray.</p>\n"
  - questions:
    - question: Should they always be extracted?
      answer: "<p>Yes in the vast majority of cases, however, there is no general
        rule for making the decision. The different criteria must be evaluated in
        each particular clinical situation, weighing thoroughly the risks and benefits
        of the intervention.</p>\n"
    - question: What is a phrenilectomy or frenectomy?
      answer: "<p>It consists of a small operation in which the lingual or labial
        frenulum is repositioned so that it does not interfere with the correct position
        of the teeth and/or tongue mobility. Very low or very fibrous labial insertions
        generate pressure and unsightly spaces between the central incisors <em>(diastemas)</em>.
        Abnormal lingual insertions cause serious phonetic and diction alterations.</p>\n"
    - question: Are cysts and tumors of the oral cavity very common?
      answer: "<p>Fortunately, they are pathologies of very low prevalence. However,
        once its existence is detected, it is imperative to study the case and immediately
        determine the therapeutic behavior to be implemented. </p>\n"
    - question: What is a biopsy and what is it done for?
      answer: "<p>It is a microscopic study of a piece of tissue or a portion of organic
        liquid that is extracted from a living being. Some biopsies involve the removal
        of a small amount of tissue with a needle, while others include surgical removal
        of the entire lesion. Usually, a biopsy is performed for the screening of
        oral cancer or for the diagnosis of ulcers, erosions and blisters that does
        not show evidence of healing within 5 to 10 days, rapidly growing nodules,
        black lesions, white lesions, red lesions with suspected erythroplasia, lesions
        without a definite diagnosis, and in some cases; for the study of infectious,
        fungal and bacterial diseases. </p>\n"
    - question: What is an apicectomy?
      answer: "<p>Apicectomy is a surgical procedure whose objective is to eliminate
        the apex <em>(end)</em> of the root of a tooth to solve a localized infectious
        process of endodontic origin. This type of surgery is performed only if other
        more conservative treatments such as conventional endodontics have failed,
        if it is impossible to access the apex of the root, if there are false ducts
        in the affected tooth, or when inside it, has fractured some instrument of
        intraradicular use. </p>\n"
    - question: When are bone grafts indicated?
      answer: "<p>Usually in cases of advanced periodontal disease and in cases where
        the quantity and quality of the recipient bone are not favorable for the placement
        of dental implants. Although there are several types of grafts, a mixed technique
        is usually executed. Autologous bone taken from the same patient <em>(autograft)</em>
        and lyophilized bone of animal origin <em>(xenograft)</em> are usually placed
        at the same time.</p>\n"
    - question: Is inflammation normal after an Oral Surgery procedure?
      answer: "<p>It is natural to experience some swelling after any surgery. A surgical
        cut in the skin or mucosa, also called incision, is a form of aggression to
        the organism. The body's natural response to an injury of this type is the
        inflammatory process, which as we know, occurs with increased volume. However,
        if the inflammation becomes exaggerated, contact your Specialist immediately.</p>\n"
    - question: Is it necessary to take antibiotics, analgesics and anti-inflammatories?
      answer: "<p>Depends on the situation. Simple procedures rarely require postoperative
        medication, however, more complex interventions do. We generally prescribe
        a broad-spectrum antibiotic and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic
        <em>(NSAID)</em>.</p>\n"
    - question: In case of bleeding, what is the behavior to follow?
      answer: "<p>It is normal to suffer slight bleeding during the first 24 hours.
        If this bleeding is more intense <em>(hemorrhage)</em>, then one or more gauze
        should be folded, placed on the wound and compressed by biting gently with
        the opposing teeth until the blood stops. If it is necessary to place more
        gauzes, never remove the first ones, apply new ones on these. Place ice and
        avoid to lying down. If the problem persists, contact your Specialist immediately.</p>\n"
    - question: How long should the sutures remain in the mouth?
      answer: "<p>It all depends on the case and extent of the procedure. As a general
        rule, a period of between 7 and 10 days is sufficient, however, it could be
        extended for a longer time. At present it is very common to use resorbable
        sutures that, for being biodegradable, do not require a second clinical intervention
        for their removal.</p>\n"
