  content: Undoubtedly, the best alternative for those patients with Large Bone Loss
    in their upper jaws and in which it is no longer possible to place conventional
    dental implants. “An optimal solution to a complex problem".
paragraphSection:
  body: "<p>\n When one or more teeth are lost, and they are not replaced as soon
    as possible, a slow but progressive process of reabsorption at the level of the
    maxillary bone is started immediately, which reduces the amount of bone structure
    available, and necessary, for the placement of dental implants. \"What is not
    used is atrophied\", and it is precisely what happens to the EDENTULOUS MAXILLARY
    ALVEOLAR PROCESS, naturally, as a result of the lack of stimulation due to the
    absence of functional loads. So \n  <strong>\n    if a lot of time elapses between
    tooth mutilation and the intention of rehabilitation, it is very likely that by
    then there is no longer enough bone material capable of guaranteeing good primary
    anchorage and adequate osseointegration of conventional titanium devices,</strong>\n
    \ that a once implanted, they should function as artificial substitutes for dental
    roots and solid supports for the fixation of prosthetic structures.\n</p>\n<p>\n
    \ Fortunately in many cases, when the defect of the alveolar ridge is mild and
    located, it is possible to resort without problems to the placement of autologous
    or synthetic GRAFTS as a prior or simultaneous step to the placement of dental
    implants. However, if the bone loss is very large and widespread, these procedures
    usually become very uncomfortable, complex, extensive and unpredictable, since
    they imply the need to generate a large body wound at the level of the pelvis
    or head to collect iliac crest or calotte bone blocks', high chances of rejection
    due to the own cruelty of the surgical technique and a period of tissue healing
    that could involve to 5 or 6 months of waiting, before being able to continue
    with the treatment.\n</p> <p>Faced with such eventualities, <strong>it is often
    preferable to forget about the maxillary and grafts, and fix the implants to other
    bones of the orofacial region</strong>, being by their compact structure and anatomical
    proximity the MALAR OR ZYGOMATIC <em>(which forms the cheekbone)</em> and Sphenoid
    bones, those of preference. So <strong>Zygomatic Implants are nothing more than
    special dental devices, much longer than conventional ones</strong> <em>(between
    30 and 55 mm in length)</em> and that allow us to make fixed dentures without
    inconveniences even in cases of severe or advanced maxillary atrophy; and that
    is why, in conjunction with Pterygoid Implants <em>(very similar to Zygomatics
    but that anchor at the level of the pterygomaxillary suture)</em>, they are also
    known in popular slang as <strong>\"Dental Implants for Patients with Little Bone\".</strong>
    And it is that in short, the relative simplicity of their implantation <em>(in
    relation to the placement of multiple grafts)</em>, the absence of morbidity of
    a donor area and a much shorter and favorable period of healing for the patient,
    suggest to these LONG IMPLANTS as a simpler and safer alternative for extreme
    cases, compared to other bone regeneration and oral implantology techniques.</p>

  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  blocks:
  - questions:
    - question: What does it consist of the study and treatment planning phase?
      answer: "<p>It is actually very broad and covers many considerations, but one
        of the most relevant is the assessment of the state of the patient's bone
        and dental structure through a 3D volumetric tomography. This test provides
        the Specialist with valuable information and allows him, a priori, to verify
        that the person cannot really be treated with conventional dental implants.</p>\n"
    - question: Which patients can undergo this oral implantology technique?
      answer: "<p>In principle, all those who have lost teeth and a lot of bone volume
        in their maxillary structures, and of course; aspire to a rehabilitation of
        much better quality than any option with removable dentures can offer them.</p>\n"
    - question: What are the causes of bone loss?
      answer: "<p>They are multiple, but among the most common are age, chronic periodontal
        disease, odontogenic infections, accidents and facial injuries, traumatic
        extraction of teeth and broken roots, prolonged use of removable dentures,
        cysts and respiratory or paranasal sinus infections, resection of tumor processes,
        and of course; physiological resorption as a result of the lack of interest
        or inability to replace lost teeth in a reasonable period of time.</p>\n"
    - question: Is there an age limit to qualify for the procedure?
      answer: "<p>In adults none, as long as the life expectancy of the person justify
        the investment of time and money. In fact, many of our patients are over 65
        years old.</p>\n"
    - question: What percentage of success do they currently have?
      answer: "<p>Extraordinary!, superior to conventional implants and very close
        to 100% of cases, with an average survival rate of 95% at 10 years.</p>\n"
    - question: Is it a painful treatment?
      answer: "<p>Not at all, since it is almost always done under general anesthesia.
        In addition, the postoperative period is usually very bearable, with few discomforts
        and allows the patient to rejoin his daily life in a very short time. Even
        so, the prescription of an analgesic protocol completely individualized will
        be routine and will ensure effective control of post-surgical pain in the
        most rebellious cases.</p>\n"
    - question: Could it be done only with sedation and local anesthesia?
      answer: "<p>Occasionally, and only in very favorable surgical conditions. However,
        for your peace of mind and ours, at DENTAL VIP we never belittle the delicacy
        of the procedure and always prefer general anesthesia in surgical block and
        hospital environment for this type of interventions.</p>\n"
    - question: What material are these implants made of?
      answer: "<p>Of titanium alloys for high performance. The degree of purity of
        titanium is determined by the maximum percentage of oxygen in which it is
        produced, being the grade 1 the highest purity, since its oxygen and iron
        content is very low. In total and today, there are about 40 degrees to name
        the different titanium alloys, ranging from pure titanium to combinations
        with vanadium, palladium, ruthenium, aluminum, tin and molybdenum. However,
        grade 5 titanium alloy currently represents for more than 50% of total titanium
        use worldwide and is considered a highly biocompatible material with biomechanical
        qualities superior to pure titanium.</p>\n"
    - question: What are their real advantages?
      answer: "<p>Compared to traditional oral implantology techniques, which contemplate
        heroic alveolar reconstructions with multiple autologous grafts, Long Implants
        offer the following advantages:</p> <ol>\n  <li>Avoid the high risk of rejection
        associated with maxillary grafts.\n  </li>\n  <li>They considerably reduce
        the total treatment time.\n  </li>\n  <li>They involve a much more conservative,
        safe and predictable procedure.\n  </li>\n  <li>Higher chance of success,
        since the malar bone is very compact and virtually immune to bone resorption
        <em>(not so the grafts)</em>. \n  </li>\n  <li>Lower morbidity, since it is
        not necessary to intervene on extraoral anatomical regions to collect bone.\n
        \ </li>\n  <li>High possibility of immediate loading <em>(fixed prosthesis
        the same day)</em>.\n  </li>\n  <li>Shorter and more favorable postoperative
        for the patient.\n  </li>\n  <li>Best short, medium and long term forecast.\n
        \ </li>  \n</ol> <p>In addition, the Zygomatic Implants protocol guarantees
        the barrier function of, biomechanical stability and correct distribution
        of the masticatory forces through the maxillomalar pillars; thus avoiding
        overloads and occasional fatigue failures. </p>\n"
    - question: What risks and contraindications exist?
      answer: "<p>Most studies cite sinusitis and oroantral communication as the most
        frequent postoperative complications, with an incidence of 4.93 per 100 implants
        placed. However, it is considered a prevalence so low that it further corroborates
        the high success rate achieved with these implants. In relation to contraindications,
        we have that, without taking into account any systemic condition or disease
        that could prevent a surgical act, they are very few, and generally all associated
        with pre-existing pathologies or infections within the sinus or maxillary
        antrum. So that in some cases, interconsultation and prior treatment with
        an Otolaryngologist could be essential. </p>\n"
  - questions:
    - question: How is the surgery and how long does it last?
      answer: |
        <p>The 4 most prominent techniques are that of Brånemark, Stella and Warner <em>(Sinus Slot Technique)</em>, the paramaxillary or extrasinusal technique and the ZAGA <em>(Zygoma Anatomy-Guided Approach)</em> technique of Dr. Carlos Aparicio. In the classical or Brånemark technique, Zygomatic Implants are placed maneuvering through the maxillary sinus, until the zygomatic arch is reached. In the Stella and Warner's, a more direct visualization of the base of the malar bone is achieved, thanks to the opening of a large window in the lateral wall of the paranasal antrum. In the extrasinusal, the implants are placed by the outside the maxillary bone, without involving the sinus; and in the ZAGA methodology, any possible combination of the 3 previous techniques is contemplated, in order to perform a more individualized surgery, adapted to the particular anatomy of each person.</p>
        <p>Logically, depending on the complexity of the case, number of devices to be implanted, type of approach selected, and of course, the skill of the Surgeon; between 30 and 120 minutes is the period of time necessary to anesthetize, make incisions, dissect tissues, stipulate measures and approximations, select implants, mill, drill, screw and clean, to finally, suture the wound.</p>
    - question: Can anyone Specialist perform this type of intervention?
      answer: "<p>This procedure, although not exclusive to our clinic, is not as
        common in general practice, because very few Dentists are truly trained to
        provide these treatments. The needed surgical skill for the placement of Zygomatic
        Implants requires a high level of experience, impeccable mastery of the head
        and neck anatomy and a very advanced surgical training. So only a Maxillofacial
        Surgeon, really experienced, will be the right professional.</p>\n"
    - question: Could I have any mark or scar on my face?
      answer: "<p>Never!, since the procedure is executed entirely by intraoral route.</p>\n"
    - question: Is it then necessary to remain hospitalized?
      answer: "<p>Very rarely, and only in case of any unforeseen or surgical complication
        that requires special care.</p>\n"
    - question: How is the postoperative period and how long does it take for the
        patient to recover?
      answer: "<p>The postoperative period does not usually involve major complications,
        as long as the patient scrupulously complies with the indications provided.
        The guidelines to follow may vary according to each intervention, the type
        of approach used and the particular conditions of each case; but medication
        <em>(antibiotics, analgesics and anti-inflammatories)</em>, local application
        of cold, rest and oral hygiene are essential to achieve a recovery as quickly
        and satisfactorily as possible. Usually, between 2 and 5 days is the time
        it takes for most people to restart their usual activities.</p>\n"
    - question: Are these implants more expensive than normal implants?
      answer: "<p>Undoubtedly!, taking into account that they are up to 4 times longer
        than conventional ones and much more titanium is needed for their manufacture,
        they require operating room and general anesthesia, instruments and surgical
        components of advanced design, a longer and more invasive major surgery intervention
        and the participation of an expert Maxillofacial Surgeon.</p>\n"
    - question: What type of prosthesis can next be made?
      answer: "<p>Usually a hybrid prosthesis of metal-acrylic or metal-porcelain.</p>\n"
    - question: Are they only used to fix complete dentures, that is, when all teeth
        are missing?
      answer: "<p>Yes in the past, since it was a procedure designed for this purpose,
        with 4 implants in total, 2 on each side of the upper jaw. However, at present,
        modifications of the original technique are applied that allow the Zygomatic
        or Pterygoid Implant to be placed in a suitable position and compatible with
        a rehabilitation based on fixed partial prosthodontics <em>(crowns and ceramic
        bridges)</em>. In fact, nowadays are multiple possibilities offered by these
        implants, from the placement of a single asymmetric device, to countless combinations
        with conventional implants, logically to solve the vast majority of cases,
        and in some of them, even to reduce costs.</p>\n"
    - question: Is it possible to place a fixed prosthesis the same day of the intervention,
        even if it is a provisional one?
      answer: "<p>Many times yes, since the multicortical anchor and the proven apex
        design of these implants generally provide great primary stability. However,
        it is only after surgery that it will be decided if a fixed or conventional
        prosthesis with relief in the areas where the intraoral platforms emerge is
        installed. Then, after the osseointegration period, elapsed 4, 5 or 6 months,
        the final prosthetic rehabilitation is performed.</p>\n"
    - question: After the treatment, what should I do to keep my implants for a lifetime?
      answer: "<p>Basically keep yourself in good general health, practice very good
        oral hygiene and go to the Dentist regularly. In these cases, it is highly
        recommended to carry out a lifelong follow-up <em>(clinical and radiographic)</em>
        of the patient, in order to detect in time any incipient infectious process
        or mismatch of the prosthetic components that could generate major evils.
        In addition, we usually recommend removing the prosthesis every 6 months to
        inspect and clean the implants and prosthetic attachments, the soft tissue
        that surrounds them and the base or inner face of the prosthetic structure.
