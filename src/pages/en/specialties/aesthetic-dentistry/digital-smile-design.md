        <h2>Images capture</h2>
        <p class="dv-srv-pr dv-srv-pr-45">We are fully convinced
        that clinical photography is for Dental Aesthetics what radiography is for Dentistry
        in general. "A picture says more than a thousand words" and "a picture shows
        more than a thousand details”.</p>    <p class="dv-srv-pr dv-srv-pr-45">We
        use a digital reflex camera to record the patient's mouth and face from various
        angles and profiles. To do a good job it is essential that intra and extraoral
        photographs have high resolution, good lighting, sharpness and depth of field.
        Normally we handle under JPG format.</p>

        <h2>Computer processing</h2>
        <p class="dv-srv-pl dv-srv-pl-pr">>A professional image
        processing software allows us to measure and modify the position, shape and
        dimensions of teeth and gums in order to reproduce the best possible aesthetic
        result, of course, under the golden ratio criterion <i>(1/1.618)</i> and always
        within the biologically viable limits.</p>    <p class="dv-srv-pl dv-srv-pl-pr">In
        DENTAL VIP we never use templates or serial prototypes. Our designs are completely
        personalized, realistic and adjusted to the true clinical condition of the person.

        <h2>Digital mock-up</h2>
        <p>It is the final projection,
        simulation and photomontage of the new smile. In it, you will be able to appreciate
        in detail the benefits of each and every one of the interventions suggested
        by our team of Specialists. If there were still doubt, we would then proceed
        to obtain a real plaster cast to over it reproduce the design contemplated in
        laboratory wax and duplicate it directly in the patient's mouth with a special
        acrylic resin. This splint or acrylic prototype could be used for up to a week
        and be subjected to the consideration of friends and close family.</p>

## Approval and consent

The DSD concept involves the patient in the transformation process of his own smile, making him a co-designer of the treatment and allowing him to express his expectations to the work team, to finally achieve his absolute compliance and authorization for the clinical procedure.



</div>

<div class="item np right">

## Intraoral execution

Periodontal plastic surgery, teeth whitening, cosmetic contouring, adhesive restorations, veneers and total-ceramic crowns are the most common clinical interventions in a Smile Design. Usually, the participation of two or more Specialist Dentists is necessary.

## Dental Morphology and Visagism: The Art of Customizing a Smile

It is unquestionable that to enhance the beauty of a person we must
always seek harmony between his visage, his facial features and the shape of his
teeth. But with the technique of Visagism we go even so further and seek to project
the patient's personality through the geometric pattern of his smile. Today we
know that our unconscious and emotional understanding tends to associate oval
shapes with sensitive and melancholic characters, triangular shapes with dynamic
and extroverted people, rectangular ones with strong and dominant temperaments
and square ones with serious and discrete individuals.
