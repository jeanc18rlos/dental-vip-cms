  body: "<p>In today's society, where the image is so important, a pleasant appearance
    often means the difference between success and failure; personal and professional.
    So that <b>a Healthy and Beautiful Smile is not a luxury or a whim but almost
    a necessity. The range of treatments at our disposal to correct Dental Imperfections
    is increasingly wide and affordable</b>, and the results are becoming faster,
    safer and more accurate. Among them we have TEETH WHITENING systems based on hydrogen
    or carbamide peroxides photoactivatables with high intensity halogen lamps <em>(ZOOM<sup>®</sup>
    system)</em> that provide us with remarkable and immediate benefits.</p> <p>In
    addition, <b>in the Specialty it is already routine to work with digital photographs
    for the study and computerized planning of the odontoesthetic treatment plan</b>.
    This phenomenon has been called SMILE DESIGN and gives us the possibility of applying
    a more scientific and less subjective criterion when restoring decayed, fractured,
    pigmented, rotated, separated or malformed teeth. On the other hand, <b>new adhesive
    materials based on nanotechnology allow us for their great versatility to modify
    the shape, color and size of the teeth at pleasure. In very few appointments the
    result is obvious and the transformation looks spectacular</b>. For the most complex
    cases we have the so-called PORCELAIN VENEERS, that are thin sheets of ceramic
    material that adhere firmly to the dental structures and that are indicated for
    the correction of aesthetic defects of greater extent and severity.</p> <p><b>Nowadays
    Aesthetic Dentistry has no limits</b>; except the creativity, skill and preparation
    of the professional staff.</p>\n"

  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  blocks:
  - questions:
    - question: Why is the use of clinical photography in Aesthetic Dentistry important?
      answer: "<p>An intraoral photograph provides instant visualization of the teeth
        in real time. With it we can see details difficult to appreciate with the
        naked eye; and also, allows the patient to opinion and actively participate
        in the development of his treatment plan. Another advantage of serial photography
        is the storage of images for future comparisons before and after treatment.</p>\n"
    - question: What is a smile design?
      answer: "<p>It consists of making a detailed digital study of the dental, gingival
        and facial characteristics of a person when smiling to identify what changes
        or modifications would be favorable, from the aesthetic point of view, to
        harmonize and beautify the appearance of his smile. The clinical execution
        of the design could be very conservative, from simple recontoring and teeth
        whitening, to more invasive interventions such as orthodontics, gum surgery,
        veneers making, total-ceramic crowns, and even; maxillofacial surgery. It
        all depends on the case and the patient's expectations.</p>\n"
    - question: When can and should make a smile design?
      answer: "<p>When the patient is of legal age, he wishes to improve his physical
        appearance and not escape his aesthetic perception of reality. It is really
        scary to see people with teeth that simulate “piano keys”, exaggeratedly long,
        white and monochromatic; without harmony with their own parameters and features
        and elaborate without taking into consideration that each human being is an
        exclusive and individual entity. Smile design is an invaluable tool in the
        field of Cosmetic Dentistry; as long as it is used with ethics, wisdom and
        true aesthetic criteria.</p>\n"
    - question: What parameters are used to choose the shape of the new teeth?
      answer: "<p>Race, sex, age, personality, size and shape of the face, biotype
        and gingival state, smile line, type of occlusion or bite, and of course;
        the patient's preferences and tastes. It is also very important to always
        work under the precept of the golden or divine proportion, try as much as
        possible that the new restorations keep in tune with one of the most used
        parameters in plastic surgery and aesthetic medicine; which suggests that
        a proportional ratio of 1/1,618 between the size of nearby and well-defined
        elements, it will guarantee success in the expression and projection of harmony,
        beauty and naturalness.</p>\n"
    - question: When is teeth whitening indicated?
      answer: "<p>Like any aesthetic treatment, the indication of whether or not to
        perform a teeth whitening is determined by the patient's own perception and
        needs. This procedure allows us to remove stains and dental pigmentations
        of extrinsic origin and clarify the color tone of the entire smile.</p>\n"
    - question: When is it contraindicated?
      answer: "<p>When the patient has cavities, active periodontal diseases or extreme
        dental sensitivity. In addition, in cases of intrinsic or excessively dark
        spots such as those caused by tetracyclines, internal pulp hemorrhages, alterations
        in the histological formation of enamel and dentin; and those caused as a
        result of corrosion of old metal restorations. In these cases, the realization
        of veneers or ceramic crowns would be indicated to achieve the desired color
        change.</p>\n"
    - question: Why should a Dentist do it?
      answer: "<p>Home bleaching that is sold in stores and pharmacies has a much
        lower concentration than those used in consultation. This phenomenon is due
        to the fact that the dental trays for application are universal and not custom-made,
        a condition that makes it impossible to avoid contact of the bleaching peroxide
        with the gums and mucous membranes of the patient. If these products had a
        professional concentration, they would cause great damage and caustic lesions
        to periodontal tissues.</p>\n"
    - question: How bleaches carbamide peroxide?
      answer: "<p>Upon contact with saliva, it decomposes into hydrogen peroxide and
        urea. Due to its low molecular weight, hydrogen peroxide easily penetrates
        enamel prisms and dentinary tubules, inside which it is metabolized by certain
        enzymes such as catalase, peroxidase and hydroperoxidase; releasing oxygen
        molecules as the final product that soften and eliminate pigments and interplasmic
        wastes. The high intensity blue light acts as a catalyst providing energy
        to the bleaching solution to accelerate its diffusion and oxidation within
        the dental structure.</p>\n"
    - question: How much can teeth whiten and how long do the results obtained last?
      answer: "<p>The color of the teeth is genetically determined and evaluated with
        a standardized 15-tone color guide. Thanks to a bleaching with carbamide peroxide
        we can clarify between 1 and 10 shades, which means that a very yellowish
        or grayish smile can return to show off its original white. The results usually
        last between 2 and 7 years, everything depends on the dietary, hygienic and
        social habits of the patient. In smokers, regular consumers of dark drinks
        <em>(cola, coffee and tea)</em> and diets high in citrus fruits <em>(kiwi
        or pineapple)</em>, the duration of the result can be considerably compromised.</p>\n"
    - question: Is teeth whitening a painful procedure?
      answer: "<p>At all! It is a conservative treatment that does not even require
        dental anesthesia, however, in many cases it can generate a temporary increase
        in dental sensitivity. This hypersensitivity is considered normal and is controlled
        with the use of special dentifrices and fluoride-based desensitizing gels.</p>\n"
  - questions:
    - question: What is the dental reshaping or cosmetic contouring?
      answer: "<p>Over the years, the teeth wear out and suffer microfractures that
        alter their natural shape and age the appearance of the person. With only
        make small and accurate modifications of the edges and dental angles it is
        possible to immediately recover the lost morphology and the original appearance
        of the smile. It is a painless, fast, safe and very economical procedure.</p>\n"
    - question: What are the most innovative restorative materials in Dental Aesthetics?
      answer: |
        <p>In the last decade the development of dental biomaterials has been amazing. Today we have composites or dental resins composed of nanometric filling material that provide excellent physical and aesthetic properties, and with which it is possible to achieve anterior and posterior direct adhesive restorations <em>(made in the mouth by the Dentist)</em>, perfectly smooth and polished; of brightness, color and texture similar to tooth enamel. They are indicated for the treatment of caries, fractures and aesthetic defects of little extension.</p>
        <p>For the manufacture of veneers, crowns and inlays in the laboratory, the great novelty is the use of ceramics <em>(popularly called porcelains)</em> based on Zirconium Oxide <em>(ZrO<sub>2</sub>)</em> and Lithium Disilicate <em>(LS<sub>2</sub>)</em>, with very high resistance to bending and fracture that makes it possible to completely dispense with the use of base metal alloys, and consequently; drastically improve the transparency, fluorescence and opalescence properties of the restored teeth. Among the most used state-of-the-art ceramics are: DC-Zircon<sup>®</sup> <em>(DCS)</em>, Cercon<sup>®</sup> <em>(Dentsply)</em>, In-Ceram<sup>®</sup> YZ <em>(Vita)</em>, Procera<sup>®</sup> Zirconia <em>(Nobel Biocare)</em>, Lava<sup>®</sup> <em>(3M Espe)</em> and IPS e.max<sup>®</sup> <em>(Ivoclar)</em>; among others.</p>
    - question: What are inlays and onlays?
      answer: "<p>They are a type of indirect restorations <em>(manufactured in the
        laboratory)</em> that are used to aesthetically reconstruct endodontically
        treated or heavily destroyed posterior teeth. Represents an excellent alternative
        to the typical dental crown and according to its extension they are classified
        as inlays, onlays and overlays. They are usually made with feldspathic or
        zirconia-based porcelains providing an extraordinary aesthetic appearance.</p>\n"
    - question: What is a veneer?
      answer: "<p>Dental veneers are direct restorations made of composite, or fine
        porcelain sheets that adhere exclusively to the anterior surface or vestibular
        face of the teeth to improve their shape and appearance. Dental veneers are
        used to correct fractured, stained, misaligned, worn, separated or malformed
        teeth.</p>\n"
    - question: How do inlays, veneers and crowns differ?
      answer: "<p>Inlays and veneers are partial coating restorations, that is, they
        only replace a part or portion of the tooth; while crowns restore or replace
        the entire visible part thereof. Veneers are indicated on the anterior teeth,
        the inlays and onlays on the posterior ones and the crowns on any tooth of
        the oral cavity.</p>\n"
    - question: What is then better for a front tooth, a veneer or a crown?
      answer: "<p>It all depends on the clinical conditions and requirements of the
        case. Before making a decision, the Aesthetic Dentist must evaluate factors
        such as the degree of structural integrity of the organ, appearance of the
        neighboring teeth, properties and characteristics of the enamel, pulp vitality,
        periodontal state, oral hygiene index and social and functional habits of
        the patient; among others. In the end, each type of restoration has its specific
        indications and only a successful professional criterion, depending on the
        case, will give us the answer.</p>\n"
    - question: How do these restorations stick to teeth?
      answer: "<p>Cementing is one of the most important steps because the long-term
        duration of restorations in mouth depends largely on it. It is essential that
        the clinician know and master the different adhesive systems for each ceramic
        material and each type of restoration. The cemented adhesive technique promotes
        the formation of strong chemical and mechanical bonds between tooth and restoration.</p>\n"
    - question: Are all veneers of porcelain?
      answer: "<p>No! They can also be made of composite resins by direct technique,
        in a single session and without the intervention of the dental laboratory,
        however; they are much less aesthetic, less resistant and have a shorter shelf
        life than ceramic ones. The latters can remain up to 20 years in the mouth.</p>\n"
    - question: If by smiling I show a large amount of gum, what can be done?
      answer: "<p>It depends on the case and its etiology. If the cause of the gingival
        smile is the over-eruption of the upper incisors, Orthodontics is the treatment
        of choice, to level the arch, intrude the teeth and achieve the apical migration
        of their marginal gum. If the problem is generated by an altered passive eruption,
        by a true excess of gum over the clinical crowns of the teeth, gingivectomy
        or surgical removal of the abnormal tissue will be the solution. However,
        if the condition is due to an alteration of the facial development, an excessive
        vertical growth of the upper jaw <em>(VME)</em>, only the surgical impact
        of the same through an intervention of Maxillofacial Orthognathic Surgery
        <em>(Le Fort I osteotomy)</em> will solve the problem.</p>\n"
    - question: What is a periodontal plastic surgery or gingivoplasty?
      answer: "<p>Every smile is made up of 3 basic elements: teeth, lips and gums.
        Gingivoplasty is a procedure that allows correcting the shape, size and thickness
        of the gums, so that they look thin, delineated and in perfect harmony with
        the teeth. Similarly, it is also possible to almost completely modify the
        appearance, size and thickness of the lips through a small cosmetic surgery
        called Cheiloplasty, usually performed by Doctors Specializing in Orofacial
        Plastic Surgery.</p>\n"
