        <h2>Teeth whitening at home</h2>
        <p class="dv-srv-pr dv-srv-pr-45">It is indicated in the simplest cases. The technique usually consists of using a gel and a transparent plastic splint custom made that is left on the teeth for a certain period of time, usually during the nights to sleep.</p>
          <p class="dv-srv-pr dv-srv-pr-45">However, performing the act only once will not yield greater results. It must be a constant process that can last several days or weeks, depending on the concentration of the product. Its main drawback is that the results tend to be unstable and not very durable. </p>

        <h2>Teeth whitening in clinic</h2>
          <p class="dv-srv-pl dv-srv-pl-pr">Also called by light or photoactivation.
        This is a much more advanced procedure, in which in a single 45-minute session,
        notable results are usually achieved.</p><p class="dv-srv-pl dv-srv-pl-pr">The
        high degree of concentration of the peroxide used, makes it important to carefully
        protect the gums with a special barrier or cover. Next, the bleaching gel is
        applied, whose properties are increased thanks to the energy supplied by a high
        intensity LED light, which allows variable adjustments to provide maximum safety
        and comfort to the patient.</p>

        <h2>Combined teeth whitening</h2>
        <p>It is surely the most
        effective of all, since it combines the benefits of photoactivation and at home
        whitening techniques.</p> <p class="dv-srv-pr dv-srv-pr-45">It usually runs
        in 3 phases. The first ambulatory, where the patient applies the bleaching product
        at home for a period of 10 to 15 days. The second in clinic, where one or two
        sessions are performed with high concentration photosensitive agents. And the
        third at home, where under strict professional supervision, small and sporadic
        touch-ups are indicated to guarantee the durability of the results obtained. </p>

        <h2>Internal whitening</h2>
        <p>It is an excellent alternative
        to treat dyschromias in non-vital teeth  <em>(with root canal treatment)</em>,
        since it represents a conservative and very economical intervention compared
        to other more complex procedures such as adhesive restorations, porcelain veneers
        and ceramic crowns. </p><p class="dv-srv-pr dv-srv-pr-45">It usually involves
        the endodontic approach of the tooth, sealing of the root canal, application
        of bleaching solutions of the highest concentration, washing and final filling.
        Several clinical sessions are usually required to achieve the desired color. </p>

      <h2 class="dv-div-title dv-pb-40">Benefits of a professional teeth whitening</h2></p>
      <p class="dv-div-text dv-pb-15">Undoubtedly, the main benefit is the personal
      satisfaction of having a more attractive dentition that allows the patient to
      feel comfortable and pleased with his smile, self-confident and better valued
      by society. In addition, it is irrefutable the fact that a white and neat teeth
      immediately project an appearance of good hygiene and personal care.</p><p class="dv-div-text
      dv-pb-15">However, aesthetic and psychological factors are not the only advantages,
      since numerous studies have demonstrated the effects of carbamide peroxide as
      a local antiseptic and its important action in reducing plaque and periodontal
      disease indexes; considerably promoting the health of teeth and gums.</p>
