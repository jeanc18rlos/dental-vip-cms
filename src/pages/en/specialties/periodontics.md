  content: The main cause of Periodontitis is dental plaque, an accumulation of food
    debris and bacteria that is deposited on the surface of teeth and gums when the
    person lacks an adequate oral hygiene technique.
paragraphSection:
  body: "<p>This Dental Specialty is focusing in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment
    of all infectious diseases <em>(GINGIVITIS and PERIODONTITIS)</em> that attack
    the teeth fixation apparatus: gums, alveolar bone, cement and periodontal ligament;
    and which are responsible for up to 80 % of dental losses in subjects over 35
    years old. <strong>It is not enough with have healthy teeth, the health of the
    gums is as or more important than staying caries free.</strong></p> <p><strong>Usually,
    treatment involves the elimination and control of local infectious irritants such
    as bacterial plaque and dental calculus</strong> through deep tartrectomies <em>(cleanings)</em>
    and the teaching of proper oral hygiene techniques. In more advanced cases it
    is usually necessary to implement more complex surgical procedures that involve
    scaling&nbsp;and&nbsp;root planing, periodontal flaps, bone grafts, membranes
    placement and the so-called GUIDED TISSUE REGENERATION.</p> <p><strong>Periodontal
    Disease is almost always asymptomatic in its early stages, which is why it is
    so dangerous and destructive</strong>. When the first signs such as brushing bleeding,
    tooth separation and dental mobility appear; we are generally in the presence
    of advanced phases of it. <strong>Without specialized treatment all the support
    bone is lost and then the teeth will loosen and fall </strong><strong><br /> irremedibly</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
    <p>Another additional benefit of this Specialty is that we can obtain from the
    so-called PERIODONTAL PLASTIC SURGERY, that includes a set of techniques that
    allow the Dentist <strong>to modify the gum's contour, thickness and shape</strong>;
    achieving invaluable aesthetic effects for patients. Generally this type of surgery
    is complementary to treatments of orthodontics, whitening and dental aesthetics.</p>

  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  blocks:
  - questions:
    - question: How is a healthy gum?
      answer: "<p>Under normal conditions, the gum is fine, thin, resilient, firmly
        adhered to the underlying bone tissue and arranged in such a way that its
        contours faithfully the cervical surface of the teeth; forming a well-defined
        scalloping. It must cover the entire root, be coral pink and have a pointed
        surface texture very similar to the peel of an orange.</p>\n"
    - question: How are periodontal diseases classified?
      answer: "<p>Although their scientific classification is extremely extensive
        and complex, it would suffice to know that of all periodontal diseases gingivitis
        is the most common, mild and with best prognosis; since its evolution only
        affects the marginal gum and its damage is completely reversible. But if it
        is not treated on time, it advances and attacks the alveolar bone, causing
        infection, reabsorption and loss of it <em>(Periodontitis)</em> with formation
        of periodontal sacs, pus and recession of the gum. When losing their support
        bone, the teeth gradually loosen until falling. Although Periodontitis can
        be localized or generalized, chronic, aggressive, necrotizing, associated
        with systemic diseases, drugs, endo-periodontal lesions or other acquired
        conditions; the most important thing is that the Specialist knows to recognize
        to which of the variants he faces to be able to establish an adequate and
        effective periodontal treatment that offers the greatest chance of success.</p>\n"
    - question: What are their causes?
      answer: "<p>They are essentially of bacterial etiology. Although the accumulation
        of dental plaque on the teeth is decisive for the onset and progression of
        periodontal disease, its severity and response to treatment will be the result
        of the interaction of a large number of modifying, contributing and/or predisposing
        factors. So, in the end, we can say that it is a pathology of multifactorial
        origin.</p>\n"
    - question: At what age do they usually appear?
      answer: "<p>With the exception of gingivitis, periodontal diseases are rarely
        diagnosed before 15 years old, although to do it, is under forms very severe
        and aggressive that seriously threaten teething, and even; the general health
        of the child. They usually appear in adults, starting their first manifestations
        at an early age, around 25 years old. The younger the individual is at the
        time of appearing, the more severe their evolution will probably be and complex
        their treatment. There is no doubt that the incidence of periodontopathies
        is directly proportional to the age of people.</p>\n"
    - question: What other factors can trigger them?
      answer: "<p>Tobacco, alcohol and stress. Also some medications and systemic
        diseases such as diabetes, osteoporosis or severe immunosuppression states.
        Defective, over-contoured or poorly adjusted restorations, crooked or crowded
        teeth <em>(malocclusions)</em> and poor oral hygiene are also factors that
        trigger and stimulate the pathogenic potential of periodontal diseases.</p>\n"
    - question: Is there any relationship between periodontal disease and pregnancy?
      answer: "<p>Pregnancy causes many hormonal changes that exponentially increase
        the risk of periodontal disease in women, and this in turn, is associated
        with preeclampsia, low birth weight and premature birth. Periodontal disease,
        by suppose a deposit of microorganisms and their toxic products, can trigger
        a response with systemic risk. Therefore, expectant women should always seek
        immediate care for periodontal disease and thus reduce the risk of pre and
        postnatal complications.</p>\n"
    - question: How can  periodontopathies be prevented?
      answer: "<p>Keeping gums healthy throughout life should not be as difficult
        as it seems. We only need constancy in the hygiene and care of our mouth,
        to prevent the formation of calculus and bacterial plaque. In addition, periodic
        visits to the Dentist are essential to achieve a deeper cleaning, especially
        in those places of difficult access for both, the brushes and dental floss.</p>\n"
    - question: How can I know if my gum is already sick?
      answer: "<p>The most obvious signs are spontaneous bleeding or to tooth brushing,
        the appearance of pus with a bad taste or smell of the mouth, redness or retraction
        of the gum, change in the position of the teeth, sensitivity, pain and dental
        mobility. The definitive diagnosis should always be accomplished by the Dentist
        after performing a thorough clinical examination and a complete radiological
        study.</p>\n"
    - question: Is periodontal disease curable?
      answer: '<p>It depends on the variant. Gingivitis is completely reversible and
        curable. However, different forms of periodontitis cause irreversible damage
        to the dental insertion apparatus. Considering the moderate and advanced variants
        of PD as chronic and controllable entities, but with a high risk of recurrence,
        it is difficult to speak of total curing. A patient with periodontitis, apart
        from learning, mastering and conscientiously applying the various oral hygiene
        techniques, must maintain a regular lifetime control with his Periodontist,
        to stabilize his condition over time and achieve what we know today as a "reduced
        but healthy periodontium"; a periodontium affected to some extent but with
        a capacity for regeneration and no evidence of active disease. Under this
        condition, natural dentition may be preserved for many more years.</p>

'
    - question: Can I recover lost bone?
      answer: "<p>Sometimes the defects produced in the maxillary structure due to
        periodontal disease have very specific characteristics that enable its bone
        regeneration. Guided tissue regeneration procedures are applied in different
        ways, either in the form of filler material, resorbable membranes or with
        substances derived from organic proteins that stimulate bone growth. These
        procedures are complex and require a high professional qualification, but
        we reiterate, they are only possible in some very specific occasions; generally
        in well-defined vertical defects.</p>\n"
  - questions:
    - question: Is the dental mobility produced by periodontitis reversible?
      answer: "<p>Mobility usually persists despite periodontal treatment because,
        unfortunately, the general level of bone never recovers. The teeth that show
        mobility at the time of diagnosis could be lost in the short or medium term
        despite the treatment, and it is the reason that justifies the need for early
        diagnosis and control of the disease.</p>\n"
    - question: Are antibiotics useful in general therapy?
      answer: "<p>Antibiotics are substances capable of eliminating or inactivating
        bacteria, and periodontal disease as an infection, is susceptible to their
        mechanisms of action. However, and due to its chronic nature, it is not feasible
        to use them continuously in cases of periodontitis, since their prolonged
        use would generate bacterial resistance and unacceptable side effects on the
        organism. Currently, it is recommended to use antibiotics only against the
        most aggressive variants, in the acute phase, for a well-defined period of
        time and always with the help of a culture-antibiogram that reveals the most
        effective drug for each particular situation.</p>\n"
    - question: What is the difference between a tartrectomy and a root planing?
      answer: "<p>Prophylaxis, cleaning or tartrectomy are the same thing, they are
        three terms that are used interchangeably to refer to the professional removal
        of plaque and supragingival calculus, that one which is visible and that is
        formed on the exposed surface of the tooth, above the gum. However, in patients
        with bone loss we must do a much deeper cleaning that eliminates the periodontal
        sacs, the tartar that is inside them and the infected root cement. This procedure
        is known as scaling and root planing. Another variant is periodontal curettage,
        a surgical technique that goes beyond and not only removes infected cement,
        but also part of the soft tissue of the periodontal pocket&rsquo;s wall. It
        is a technique that is currently used only in very particular situations.</p>\n"
    - question: How is a periodontal pocket or pathological sac?
      answer: "<p>In health conditions, the gum joins the tooth through an epithelial
        insertion forming a groove <em>(gingival groove)</em> of between 1 and 3 mm.
        deep. A periodontal pocket is a degenerative lesion of the periodontium, an
        abnormal space <em>(greater than 4 mm.)</em> that forms between the gum and
        the tooth, at the level of the gingival groove, as a result of the constant
        accumulation of plaque and bacteria below of the gum. Due to its depth, the
        presence of pathological sacs completely impede the removal of dental plaque
        by the patient and favors the formation of tartar, the destruction of the
        supporting bone and the aggravation of periodontal disease.</p>\n"
    - question: What does it consist of and when is a flap surgery indicated?
      answer: "<p>A periodontal flap is a gum portion that is surgically separated
        from the underlying tissues to allow access, visibility and cleanliness of
        the bone and root surfaces. We could essentially consider it as an open subgingival
        curettage. It is one of the most used treatments in advanced periodontitis
        and its basic objectives are to remove calculus and plaque from inaccessible
        areas, eliminate or reduce periodontal pockets, ensure a more favorable tissue
        contour and increase the amount of attached gum. In addition, in some patients
        with severe retractions, exposed roots or mucogingival defects, a flap allows
        us to move the gum to different positions to correct lesions by default.</p>\n"
    - question: When is a bone graft placed?
      answer: "<p>The surgical techniques currently available only allow to graft
        bone in some types of periodontal lesions and, often, only partially. The
        unique defects in which the scientific literature has demonstrated the effectiveness
        of grafts are vertical type lesions <em>(circumscribed defects of 1, 2 or
        3 walls) </em>and those of furca in lower molars. Unfortunately, regenerative
        procedures fail when attempts are made to treat horizontal lesions <em>(the
        most common in periodontal disease) </em>or any furca defect in the upper
        molars. Conversely, bone grafts are highly effective in increasing the quantity
        and quality of bone in the recipient bed as a procedure prior to the placement
        of dental implants.</p>\n"
    - question: How are gingival recessions or retractions treated?
      answer: "<p>The first thing, before performing any type of surgical intervention,
        is to eliminate the cause that has caused the gum retraction: aggressive brushing,
        excessive consumption of acidic substances, occlusal trauma, parafunctional
        habits and/or permanent accumulation of local irritants <em>(plaque bacterial
        and dental calculus). </em>Then, continuity is given to treatment with mucogingival
        surgeries such as coronal advancement flaps to &ldquo;stretch&rdquo; the gum
        and cover the exposed root and/or with sub-epithelial connective grafts taken
        from the palatine mucosa.</p>\n"
    - question: What is the periodontal support or maintenance phase?
      answer: "<p>It is the phase of periodontal therapy during which the disease
        is monitored to control its etiological and risk factors. It is considered
        from the clinical point of view, an active therapy, which should have the
        same professional attention and importance as the initial or attack therapy.
        Its main objective is to prevent the progression and recurrence of periodontal
        disease in patients who have been previously treated. It usually requires
        periodic visits, every 3 months at the beginning, to rule out the presence
        of local irritants, clinical signs of inflammation and to verify the full
        mastery over execution of the different oral hygiene techniques.</p>\n"
    - question: What to do if I finally lose some teeth?
      answer: "<p>If you went to treatment late or if your periodontitis could not
        be adequately controlled, you may lose or have lost teeth as a result of it.
        In that case, it is convenient that you replace them immediately to avoid
        functional overloads of those ones who still remain in the mouth, a fact that
        would significantly accelerate the general evolution of the disease. The best
        way to replace your teeth is by means of fixed prosthesis, since removable
        devices usually damage the gum and the remaining natural teeth, so they should
        be placed only if there is no possibility of making a fixed one.</p>\n"
    - question: If I have periodontitis, can I opt for dental implants?
      answer: "<p>Of course yes!, and it is in fact the ideal alternative, but never
        in cases of active periodontal disease. First it is necessary to treat and
        control it so that the implants behave equal and have the same chances of
        success as in a healthy patient. If we take into account that from the periodontal
        point of view dental implants are subject to the same risks of infection as
        natural teeth, we will understand why it is essential, to prevent implants
        from running the same fate, that a person who has lost their teeth due to
        failures of oral hygiene be trained and qualified in the techniques of brushing
        and flossing.</p>\n"
