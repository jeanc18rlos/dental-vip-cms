<p>
  International electronic bank transfers <em>(WIRE transfers) </em>that use the SWIFT code allow operations without additional charges to the rates established by your bank. This is one of the most popular payment methods, since it avoids the inconvenience of transferring cash and the limitations that many times impose the use of cards. If you choose this option, keep in mind that this type of transaction usually takes between 2 and 5 business days, so we recommend doing it with some anticipation upon arrival.
</p>
<p>
  If you have a bank account in the United States of America and are registered in the <b>Zelle app</b>, you can use this service to transfer money almost immediately, conveniently and securely with just the names and email addresses associated with our accounts.
</p>
<p>
  In case of error, overdraft or suspension of the treatment for personal reasons and/or beyond our control, DENTAL VIP undertakes to immediately reimburse all the funds provided, without any type of penalty or administrative charge.

<p class="message">
  Unless agreed differently during the initial interview, the work days contemplated in the treatment plan will always be full business days during which the patient must be available between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
