      testimonial:
        “After 11 implants and 11 ceramic crowns in the center, I have always
        had very good experiences. I was honestly very satisfied with the services of
        DENTAL VIP. Implants are a great success, and the only thing I regret is not
        having done it before. Thanks to everyone, and especially Dr. Garabán, for his
        patience, human quality and professional ethics”.

      testimonial:
        “Before I was embarrassed to smile because I was not satisfied with
        the appearance of my teeth. Since I visited DENTAL VIP I feel more comfortable
        and sure of myself. They made me a digital smile design, cut my gums, bleached
        my teeth and placed me four truly spectacular porcelain veneers. I would recommend
        them with my eyes closed”.

    - img: /img/testimonials-carlos.png
      testimonial:
        “After two orthodontic treatments and more than 5 years with braces,
        I thought that my case had no solution. Almost without hope, and only because
        of the results I observed in my cousin Marta, I decided to visit Dr. José Miguel
        Gómez. In just 3 months with my new brackets I noticed an impressive improvement,
        and finally, I was able to recover my smile. I learned that, definitely, cheap
        is very expensive”.

      testimonial:
        “I needed to put on dental implants and I didn't know who to trust.
        I requested several opinions and finally decided on DENTAL VIP, and not because
        it was a recognized clinic, but because they offered me the best guarantees
        and gave me a lot of security. Now that I have finished the treatment I can
        say that I was delighted and that the whole team seemed me very close and professional”.

      testimonial:
        “I found myself in need of going to the clinic to treat some cavities
        and getting two root canal treatments. I would recommend to DENTAL VIP for the
        advice provided, for the easy access to its location, for the receptivity of
        its staff, for its impeccable facilities, and above all; because the procedures
        were executed without any kind of pain. Very good Dentists”.
