    testimonial: "“After 11 implants and 11 ceramic crowns in the center, I have always
      had very good experiences. I was honestly very satisfied with the services of
      DENTAL VIP. Implants are a great success, and the only thing I regret is not
      having done it before. Thanks to everyone, and especially Dr. Garabán, for his
      patience, human quality and professional ethics”.\n"

    testimonial: "“Before I was embarrassed to smile because I was not satisfied with
      the appearance of my teeth. Since I visited DENTAL VIP I feel more comfortable
      and sure of myself. They made me a digital smile design, cut my gums, bleached
      my teeth and placed me four truly spectacular porcelain veneers. I would recommend
      them with my eyes closed”.\n"

    testimonial: "“After two orthodontic treatments and more than 5 years with braces,
      I thought that my case had no solution. Almost without hope, and only because
      of the results I observed in my cousin Marta, I decided to visit Dr. José Miguel
      Gómez. In just 3 months with my new brackets I noticed an impressive improvement,
      and finally, I was able to recover my smile. I learned that, definitely, cheap
      is very expensive”.\n"

    testimonial: "“I needed to put on dental implants and I didn't know who to trust.
      I requested several opinions and finally decided on DENTAL VIP, and not because
      it was a recognized clinic, but because they offered me the best guarantees
      and gave me a lot of security. Now that I have finished the treatment I can
      say that I was delighted and that the whole team seemed me very close and professional”.\n"

    testimonial: "“I found myself in need of going to the clinic to treat some cavities
      and getting two root canal treatments. I would recommend to DENTAL VIP for the
      advice provided, for the easy access to its location, for the receptivity of
      its staff, for its impeccable facilities, and above all; because the procedures
      were executed without any kind of pain. Very good dentists”.\n"
