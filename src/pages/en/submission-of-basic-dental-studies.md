As is logical, and before traveling, it is highly recommended that we know your general health status, personal expectations and oral conditions to determine the indication and feasibility of performing the surgical, restorative or cosmetic desired procedures.

For this, it is essential that you remit us certain personal information and send by email to [contacto@dentalvip.com.ve](mailto:contacto@dentalvip.com.ve) some basic dental records that allow us to diagnose, plan your treatment and guarantee the satisfaction of our service.

A good oral diagnostic center of your area will undoubtedly be able to perform all the pertinent studies. If required, ask your general dentist for the order forms.

Count on with some clinical photographs and dental radiographs will be sufficient in aesthetic cases, while facial tomographies and hematological profiles will be essential for surgical or dental implant treatments. All studies must be recent, with a maximum validity of 3 months after their issuance date.

Listed below are the diagnostic resources that we need in the vast majority of cases to start the path to your new smile on the right foot:

![Basic Diagnostic Records List for Cosmetic and Implant Dentistry.](/img/submission of basic dental studies 2.jpg)

**1- CONSULTATION EMAIL _(Personal Data, Current Condition and Real Expectations)_**

Always to [contacto@dentalvip.com.ve](mailto:contacto@dentalvip.com.ve)

Brief written description that specifies your name, sex, age, country of residence and current medical condition. If this is the case, it must voice the existence of any pathology or state of general order that could condition dental care _(allergies, pregnancy, diabetes, high blood pressure, ischemic heart disease, osteoporosis and blood clotting disorders; among others),_ as well as medication prescribed for their control.

Similarly, it is necessary to express in it your immediate oral requirements and the dental treatments or procedures to which you aspire.

**2- EXTRAORAL DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHS**

Photographic set containing at least 5 extraoral pictures: frontal facial at rest, frontal facial with exaggerated smile, right profile, left profile and, very important, a front dentogingival-facial image during a normal smile _(framing only lips, teeth and gums)_ shows the teeth and gums in relation to the surrounding lips to assess the degree of maxillary gingival exposure.

**4- PANORAMIC DENTAL X-RAY**

To evaluate the maxillary and articular structure altogether and rule out the presence of fractures, cysts or tumor processes.

**5- INTRAORAL PERIAPICAL RADIOGRAPHIC STUDY**

**6- COAGULATION PROFILE _(for Surgery and Dental Implants only)_**

That includes at least: Prothrombin Time _(PT),_ Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time _(APTT),_ Fibrinogen, Platelet Count and the International Normalized Ratio _(INR)_ in that patients who follow an AVK anticoagulant treatment.

Once the files have been received _(in Word, PDF, JPG or PNG formats),_ your case will be immediately submitted to an exhaustive multidisciplinary evaluation by our specialists team to be able to issue a specific treatment proposal as soon as possible, including of course the final quote and estimated execution time.

WARNING: usually it is not possible to send 3D studies by regular email as they form heavy files that exceed 25 MB. If you need to send a tomography or any other special record you should use tools such as Google Drive or Dropbox that allow you to first store the files in the cloud and then share a link to them by email. Please check the next post to get more information about it wwwfghhjkl
