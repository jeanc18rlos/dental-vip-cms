          For us it is essential that you get to understand and reason what your
          dental problem is, what were its causes and what are its consequences
          and therapeutic alternatives, so that together we can give it solution
          and can also prevent its recurrence. Remember that &nbsp;
          <strong>prevention is the cornerstone of any health strategy.</strong>

        Many patients go to a dental insurance, a franchise or a popular
          clinic for the price they offer, but generally the care is very basic,
          massive, little specialized and offered by itinerant dentists who are
          just beginning in the profession.&nbsp;
          <strong>
            When it comes to private attention, always mistrust of free
            consultations, 2x1 offers and excessively low fees, since they
            usually hide a great deterioration in the quality of care
          </strong>
          that can put your health at risk and make you easy prey to
          professional malpractice. Work very fast, attend to many patients,
          delegate functions and spare the most in academic training,
          infrastructure, technology, biosafety and expenses of clinical
          material is a common philosophy in those who tender cheap dentistry.
