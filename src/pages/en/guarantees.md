  title: Our Guarantee Policy
  content: "<p  class=\"dv-subtitle text-left\"> The guarantee is often overlooked
    by patients when deciding which dental clinic to choose, and in our opinion, it
    is one of the most important factors that differentiates one dental center from
    another.</p>\n <br> \n<p class=\"dv-subtitle text-left\"p> DENTAL VIP can offer
    you the most extensive guarantee available from any dental clinic in Venezuela
    because we are confident in the high standard of our workmanship, in the quality
    of the materials we use and in the precision of the dental technicians who work
    in our master laboratory.</p> <br>  <p class=\"dv-subtitle text-left\"p> If our
    guaranteed treatment fails structurally, it will be replaced free of charge for
    you by our Dentists, of course, under the terms and conditions detailed below.
    This gives you that peace of mind that if anything is to happen, we are here to
    take responsibility!</p>\n"

<div class="green message"> In a guarantee case, we cover accommodation expenses but not those of flight and airfare </div> <p> Below is an overview of the guarantee times for the different types of dental solutions we offer: </p> <br> <div class="percentaje"> <div class="progress-bar"> <span class="progress-bar-fill" style="width: 17%;"></span> </div> <div class="title">REPAIRS</div> <div class="time">6 months</div> </div> <div class="percentaje"> <div class="progress-bar"> <span class="progress-bar-fill" style="width: 34%;"></span> </div> <div class="title">FILLINGS</div> <div class="time">1 year</div> </div> <div class="percentaje"> <div class="progress-bar"> <span class="progress-bar-fill" style="width: 68%;"></span> </div> <div class="title">REMOVABLE SOLUTIONS</div> <div class="time">2 years</div> </div> <div class="percentaje"> <div class="progress-bar"> <span class="progress-bar-fill" style="width: 68%;"></span> </div> <div class="title">PORCELAIN VENEERS</div> <div class="time">2 years</div> </div> <div class="percentaje"> <div class="progress-bar"> <span class="progress-bar-fill" style="width: 68%;"></span> </div> <div class="title">FIXED SOLUTIONS</div> <div class="time">2 years</div> </div> <div class="percentaje"> <div class="progress-bar"> <span class="progress-bar-fill" style="width: 100%;"></span> </div> <div class="title">DENTAL IMPLANTS (ZIMMER BIOMET)</div> <div class="time">3 years</div> </div> <br> <p> The main requirement to enforce the warranty right in cases of dental implants, fixed prosthodontics and porcelain veneers is the constant use of the night splint supplied at the end of the treatment. For this purpose, it must be presented upon arrival for its evaluation and to verify, according to its degree of natural wear, the correct use of it. No guarantee will be valid if the device is not presented, if it is not adjusted correctly due to lack of use or if a splint other than that made by our Specialists is detected. </p> <p> Another requirement for the guarantee to be valid is to attend an annual check-up and professional dental cleaning. Although you can have your regular checkups in your home country, to maintain the guarantee, you must send us an email with the bill of the treatment, a complete set of intraoral photographs and a panoramic x-ray to be archived in your file and be aware of your clinic condition. The timelessness in the execution of this requirement or in the reception of said records will automatically cancel any responsibility in terms of guarantee. </p> <p> Circumstances that can endanger the longevity of dental work are mainly allergies, diabetes and smoking. In these cases, two annual checkups are obligatory for the guarantee to be valid, and one of them has to be done at our clinic. With some specific risk factors we cannot offer any type of guarantee, but we will always inform you of this beforehand. </p> <div class="message red"> Excluding risk factors: <ul> <li>Immune or degenerative pathologies</li> <li>Accidents and severe trauma</li> <li>Systemic diseases that have a detrimental effect on the body such as uncontrolled diabetes, epilepsy, osteoporosis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); among others</li> <li>Radio or chemotherapy</li> <li>Heavy smoking</li> </ul> </div> <p> The warranty is invalidated if the patient or a third party modifies, without our authorization, the prosthesis or dental work. Similarly, plastic and acrylic parts, temporary solutions, extensions and coatings are not covered; as well as no future endodontics or pulp inflammation treatment. </p> <p> Occasionally, the teeth suffer trauma during the preparation of crowns and bridges, and that subsequently merit root canal treatment. As such circumstance is unpredictable in the vast majority of cases, DENTAL VIP cannot be held responsible for any endodontic pathology that is not evident at the time of the initial consultation and diagnosis. </p> <p> Any expense or amount incurred in another dental clinic, such as the final cementation of a definitive fixed prosthesis, is beyond the coverage of this guarantee policy. </p> <p> To achieve the greatest possible longevity of your oral rehabilitation, it will be our responsibility to provide you with specific professional recommendations. Even so, in case of doubt or disagreement in terms of guarantees, we reserve the right to submit the treatment given to the evaluation of independent professional experts. </p> <h4> What happens if I have to make use of the guarantee? </h4> <p> Several statistical studies show that very few dental patients need to take advantage of the guarantee offered by their dental clinics in South America. Even so, this demonstrates that even with optimal planning and execution, the possibility of a problem should never be completely ruled out. However, if necessary, the most important thing is to have agreed in advance how to address the problem. </p> <p> DENTAL VIP offers a very comprehensive and patient-friendly guarantee policy. If you have to make it effective and reside outside of Venezuela, we can organize your trip in the usual conditions and cover the following: </p> <ul class="check-list"> <li> <i class="icon-check circle"></i> Flight booking </li> <li> <i class="icon-check circle"></i> Hotel booking </li> <li> <i class="icon-check circle"></i> Airport pick-up and drop off </li> <li> <i class="icon-check circle"></i> Accommodation up to a maximum of $350 USD </li> <li> <i class="icon-check circle"></i> Dental retreatment free of charge </li> </ul> <h4> How is the procedure performed? </h4> <p> Come immediately to consult or send photos and a brief description of the problem through our contact forms. If it is necessary to return to Caracas, we will examine your medical history and the images provided to try to determine why the failure occurred, plan the retreatment and make effective, if applicable, the guarantee policy already described. </p>
