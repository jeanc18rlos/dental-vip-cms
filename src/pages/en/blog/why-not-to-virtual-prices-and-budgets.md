It is an alarming reality _- in the face of the serious social and economic crisis we are experiencing -_ the fact that more and more people call or write emails to dental clinics, as if they were department stores, with the sole intention of investigating **on the “approximate” prices of the most frequent and demanded dental treatments**, to then make elementary comparisons, and frequently; Choose between the cheapest options. However, there is hardly any conduct of greater naivety, risk and irresponsibility in the field of private health. No one conscious and moderately rational, can expect greater benefit from such an inappropriate selection criteria, and even less, in complex restorative treatments or dental aesthetics that require state-of-the-art allegations and ceramics, high professional qualification, a lot of clinical experience and mandatory support of digital technology

So DENTAL VIP has never had _-nor will participate-_ in such a painful commercial dynamic. Among the many reasons that prevent us from disclosing virtual figures and budgets by telephone and / or email, we justify the greatest relevance:

**BECAUSE we are true health professionals ...**

Because we are not mere merchants, we would do nothing with resellers, brackets, crowns, teeth whitening or dental implants, we were not trained to deal with goods but with biological processes in humans. In contrast, we provide highly specialized, exclusive and personalized professional services; appropriate to the initial condition and individual diagnosis of each patient, supported by the most current and relevant scientific evidence and always focused on the achievement of clinical excellence.

**BECAUSE we act responsibly ...**

Because we cannot allow a secretary, receptionist or person in charge of digital media _- who is not a Dentist -_ to estimate the value of health treatments totally unrelated to their work. In doing so, we would promote a true act of professional intrusion and an unequivocal display of lightness and lack of seriousness.

**BECAUSE we are moved by ethics, wisdom and honesty ...**

Because we know that to be able to estimate costs and transparent budgets, we must first evaluate the patient and have a really reliable treatment plan. In other words, that in order to quantify the fair monetary value of a particular procedure - or of a comprehensive treatment - we must first know precisely the problems we face, their peculiarities and the relevant procedures for their optimal resolution. Stories derived from all the DIAGNOSTICS, from a thorough study of the case _- sometimes executed by several Specialists -_ and from the assertive planning of the operating sequence, depending on the circumstances, better application.

**BECAUSE we fight against mediocrity ...**

Because we must inform and protect the most vulnerable people from iatrogenesis and professional malpractice, advertising and make them understand that, behind the very tempting free consultations, the incredible dental offers and / or excessively low prices; They usually hide the famine, the laziness, the incapacity, the desperate marketing, the intention of wild massification and in general, a great damage of the quality of care that can put at risk your oral health, dental appearance and general well-being.

**BECAUSE we avoid speculation ...**

Because we know that it discloses the price, without detailing the characteristics of a product or service, it is a perfect breeding ground for the proliferation of inferences, comparisons and purely speculative conclusions, without any logical basis and without any significant relevance for decision making. .

**BECAUSE we respect our patients ...**

Because we owe fidelity to all the people who have trusted and trusted us, to all the people who have given their health the value it deserves, who are well aware of the importance of a first evaluation consultation, who know how to differentiate and consider the different degrees of academic training of a professional, who perceive the implications and advantages of the latest technologies in the sector, that are able to distinguish and demand brand / quality of dental supplies and materials and that for many years have honored us with their visits .

**BECAUSE we take care of our prestige ...**

Because we appreciate our training as Specialists, because we are faithful to our principles, values ​​and work philosophy, because we have very well defined and segmented our professional objective, because we comply with our criteria of differentiation and because _-despite the times-_ we have decided bet on the country, transcend and keep us as a solid and reliable alternative in the field of health, aesthetics and oral rehabilitation.

**BECAUSE we love dentistry ...**

WhyWe fell in love and married her many years ago, we take care of her, we consent to her and dignify her by putting into practice only the best customs and institutional methodologies, always with the proposal of collaborating in the growth of her reputation as a science of health and the firm hope of being able to see him one day at the same level that other medical specialties enjoy. So that he wishes to live a positive experience, seek quality dental treatment and obtain full satisfaction of his economic investment; We strongly advise you to organize, document, evaluate with maintenance the very diverse service offers and, above all, raise awareness of the need to devote part of your resources to evaluation consultations and diagnostic studies, which in the end, are only the best reflection and guarantee of a specifically specialized, ethical and professional attention. Any other way would ever imply improvisation and uncertainty of the designs of chance, which in health, are usually nefarious. To conclude, and in those cases where the economic condition does not allow following the exposed protocol, we suggest taking into consideration the different Dental faculties of the country as excellent alternatives to the highly questioned “low cost” or cheap dentistry clinics. In our capital city, the Central University of Venezuela _(UCV)_ and the Universidad Santa María_(USM)_ offer extraordinary dental treatments, very affordable and that _-although in the hands of students-_ obtain results far above the average General. The truth is that, as our remembered Oscar Yáñez affirmed,**_“call where you call, nobody sells tenderloin at the price of skin” ._**
